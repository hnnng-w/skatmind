  Player, role, seat, phase, contract, distinct-Game, distinct-Match, and bounded
  recurrence scopes without trait, quality, causal, or significance claims
* private internal deterministic Tactical Cross-game Coaching with exact
  Tactical/Teacher joins, retained exact Assessments, semantic Decision
  consensus, complete-Search-only repeated cross-Game focus, bounded Player
  Reports, and fixed Guidance without truth, trait, Rating, or causal claims

  friendly bilingual forms, secondary JSON transfer, and Product-first/profile-
  second persistence semantics
* JSON input/output for regression-friendly testing

The current implementation is not a machine-learning model or a full official
tournament system. It includes bounded late-game Perfect-Information Minimax for
exact worlds, but not a general hidden-information, complete-contract, or full
official Skat solver. Future product scope is defined in
[`docs/v1_scope.md`](docs/v1_scope.md).

## Language rules

Repository code, tests, comments, docstrings, documentation, JSON keys, CLI
output, Public API values, Routes, machine identifiers, persistence, and
generated outputs must remain in English and locale-neutral. The explicit
exception is German user-visible text in the unified frontend translation
catalog.

Planning conversation may be in German, but technical repository changes remain
English. Unified browser presentation supports German and English.

## Table assumption

The project assumes a fixed three-player Skat table. Four-player table support
is unconditionally out of scope.

## Development workflow

Use small, test-driven changes.

For each task:

1. Inspect the relevant files before editing.
2. Propose a short implementation plan.
3. Make the smallest useful change.
4. Add or update focused tests.
5. Run targeted tests first.
6. Run the full check script before considering the task complete.
7. Do not update unrelated files.
8. Do not perform broad refactors unless explicitly requested.

## Standard check command

Use this command for the full project check:

```powershell
.\scripts\check.ps1
```

The full check covers:

* Ruff checks
* packaged-schema filename and byte parity
* input JSON schema validation
* generated output JSON schema validation
* Wheel, sdist, and clean-install API/installed/module CLI validation
* pytest regression tests

## Useful focused checks

Run specific tests when working on focused areas:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/test_post_game_review.py
python -m pytest tests/test_matador_inference.py
python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py
python -m pytest tests/test_examples.py
python scripts/validate_examples_schema.py
python scripts/validate_generated_outputs_schema.py
```

## Agent governance

OpenCode and all other coding agents must not:

* commit or amend commits
* push changes
* create, switch, rename, or delete branches
* create, move, or delete tags
* create or modify GitHub Releases
* create, update, comment on, close, reopen, or otherwise modify GitHub issues

Agents may:

* inspect the repository and Git history
* edit files for an explicitly assigned task
* run focused checks and the full project check
* inspect `git status` and `git diff`
* provide a ready-to-paste concise English commit message
* provide a ready-to-paste English GitHub issue update comment

Git and GitHub publication actions are performed manually by a human maintainer.

## Current release state

The current published stable and latest stable GitHub Release is `v0.17.0`, with
release theme "Rules, Search, Coaching, and performance closure" and GitHub
Release title "v0.17.0 — Rules, Search, Coaching, and performance closure". The
maintainer published it manually on 2026-08-25 at commit
`8187fbe684559f9c0c2ba444be1bf33950359ad2` (`8187fbe`). Package version
`0.17.0` requires Python `>=3.13`, retains Public API contract version `1`,
exactly seven Root workflows, and the one `skat-ai = skat_ai.cli:main` Console
Script. The published baseline has Settlement Normative Matrix version `3` with
61 cases, 71 authoritative Schemas, 71 Packaged Schema Resources, six Session
examples, 98 deterministic generated outputs, ten private Corpus prepared
downloads, and 7,479 passing pytest tests in 921.96s. GitHub Releases is the
authoritative publication record; no Package-index or PyPI publication is
claimed.

The historical published `v0.16.0 — Learning-ready behavior and communication
data` baseline was published manually by the maintainer on 2026-08-18 at commit
`91b1360`. Package version `0.16.0` requires Python `>=3.13`, retains Public API
contract version `1`, exactly seven Root workflows, and one Console Script. It
contains 63 authoritative Schemas, 63 Packaged Schema Resources, six Session
examples, 85 deterministic generated outputs, and 6,925 passing pytest tests in
1083.48s. Issues #171 through #179 complete that functional milestone, Issue
#180 completed Release preparation, and Issue #181 synchronized publication
status without changing product behavior.

The published `v0.17.0` functional history uses Package version `0.17.0`, Python
`>=3.13`, Public API contract version `1`, exactly seven Root workflows, one
Console Script, and six Session examples. Issue #186 updates the Settlement
Normative Matrix to version `3` with the same 61 cases and implements the approved
Claim through Historical Game input only. Issue #189 adds four Information-set
Search Schemas, one example, and four generated-output scenarios. Issue #190
adds strict Information-set Search Multi-Step and Policy Comparison integration,
one example, and two scenarios without adding a Schema, bringing the working tree
to 69 authoritative and packaged Schemas and 94 scenarios. The published
`v0.16.0` counts above remain unchanged Release facts.

Issue #191 adds strict private one-Decision Match Information-set Search, exact
Report-source transfer, focused Strategy Teacher Evidence, Dataset-v2 joins,
cross-game counts, and existing Corpus workflow support without changing those
counts or public/versioned surfaces.

Issue #192 adds separate Historical Information-set Replay Coaching, private
Match Historical Information-set Review and Coaching controls, one strict
Schema, one Root example, and two append-only scenarios. The working baseline at
that point therefore has 70 authoritative and packaged Schemas and
96 scenarios.
Package version, Public API contract, seven Root workflows, one Console Script,
Settlement Matrix version `3` with 61 cases, and six Session examples remain
unchanged.

Issue #193 adds a deterministic synthetic Information-set Search benchmark
corpus, a strict repository-local runner and focused regression tests, and
documented local reference measurements. It changes no production code, Schema,
route, profile, Public API, Package version, example, generated scenario, or the
working counts above.

Issue #194 adds deterministic Historical Tactical Motif Review, private Match
browser controls, one strict Schema, one Root example, and two append-only
scenarios. The final published baseline therefore has 71 authoritative and
packaged Schemas and 98 scenarios. Existing Package/API/workflow/Console-Script/
Settlement/Session baselines remain unchanged.

Issue #195 adds private Current-Match-Snapshot-only Tactical Motif Evidence,
explicit Decision skips, exact global/Player/scope/recurrence summaries, atomic
process-local Corpus preparation, minimized presentation, and two authenticated
canonical downloads. It changes no Package/API/workflow/Console-Script/Schema/
example/generated-scenario/Session/Dataset-v2 baseline, so the working counts
above remain unchanged.

Issue #196 adds private deterministic Tactical Cross-game Coaching from exact
Tactical/Teacher joins, one Assessment per exact Teacher Report, semantic
Decision consensus, complete-Search-only repeated cross-Game focus, bounded
fixed Guidance, atomic third-family Corpus publication, minimized aggregate
presentation, and a tenth authenticated canonical download. It changes no
Package/API/workflow/Console-Script/Schema/example/generated-scenario/Session/
Dataset-v2 baseline, so the working counts above remain unchanged.

Issue #197 records the documentation-only scope and Release-readiness audit.
Issue #198 changes only Package metadata, current version expectations,
Changelog, and Release-candidate documentation to prepare `v0.17.0` without
product behavior changes. The maintainer subsequently published `v0.17.0` on
2026-08-25 at `8187fbe`, and Issue #199 performs only the post-publication
documentation synchronization. Issues #182 through #196 are the functional
milestone; Issues #197, #198, and #199 add no product functionality.

The historical published `v0.15.0` GitHub Release has release theme "Local
EuroSkat 36er Match capture, analysis, and exports" and GitHub Release title
"v0.15.0 — Local EuroSkat 36er Match capture, analysis, and exports". It points
to commit `ec1c154`. Package version `0.15.0` requires Python `>=3.13`, retains

GitHub Release title
"v0.12.0 — Fixed-three-player historical lists and deterministic dataset
preparation". It points to commit `bbf955e`, validates 70 deterministic
generated-output scenarios, and passes 4,762 pytest tests. Issues #127 through
#134 complete the functional milestone, and Issue #135 completed release
preparation. Issue #136 synchronized the historical publication status.

The historical published `v0.11.0` release, with release theme "Information-safe
Replay Coaching and structured historical outcomes", points to commit `cfd28e5`,
validates 64 deterministic generated-output scenarios, and passes 4,392 pytest
tests. Issues #118 through #124 complete that functional milestone, and Issue
#125 completed release preparation.

The published `v0.13.0` baseline implements public API contract version `1`
through Issue #137, which establishes the stable `skat_ai.api.v1` and
`skat_ai.errors` namespaces, immutable JSON document wrappers, compatibility
metadata, stable errors, Exit Code constants, and the legacy CLI-error alias. Issue #139 adds
internal Application orchestration version `1`, immutable invocation, option,
result, external-document, and artifact contracts, no-I/O dispatch for all seven
Root workflows, legacy CLI transport parity, and unchanged public API exports.
Issue #140 adds the executable public Python API v1 facade, direct immutable

Package-owned canonical CLI, the Legacy Root compatibility facade, `--version`,
and clean-install CLI/API parity. Issue #138 adds the internal version-
1 field-level provenance language, immutable sidecar ledgers, RFC 6901 paths,
coverage and dependency validation, Information Use Context, public redaction,
and safe serialization. Issue #143 adds internal Application provenance bundles,
complete live decision ledgers, Immediate, Search, inference, Multi-Step, and
Policy Comparison propagation, and an all-leaf partial-legacy Position Result
ledger. Issue #144 extends internal provenance through flat retrospective
Position Analysis, Historical Snapshots, Immediate and Search Review, Replay
Coaching, and an all-leaf partial-legacy Historical Result ledger. Issue #145
adds internal Dataset, Preparation, Opponent, Profile,
historical-list, and comparison provenance with complete non-legacy Root Result
ledgers. Issue #146 completes the remaining non-legacy Position and Historical
Result ledgers from retained Declaration, Value, Overbid, score, Result,
Settlement, Performance, list, ending, continuation, canonical record, replay,
and point values. Issue #147 adds bounded public field-provenance contract
version `1`, immutable attachments/artifacts/bundles, seven explicit Root Result
mappings, the actual
`opponent_statistics_input` artifact mapping, complete post-redaction coverage,
default-false Public API and all-three-form CLI opt-in, strict Schema, and seven
append-only generated-output scenarios. The published baseline has 62 schemas and
77 generated-output scenarios, while the historical published `v0.12.0` facts
remain 70 scenarios and 4,762 tests.

The published `v0.14.0` milestone has the release theme "End-to-end Live and
Retrospective Session capture". Issue #150 establishes internal Session
contract and Command version `1`, stable Players and seats, Capture Modes,
phases, an authoritative accepted Command Log, linear revisions, Diagnostics,

Position builder validation, and immutable replay-verified pre-Play Decision
Checkpoints. Issue #154 adds internal Session History Edit version `1`, immutable
strict-prefix Undo, one-command correction with deterministic first-rejection
suffix replay, partial corrected States, and current/ancestor/future/diverged
Checkpoint lineage. Issue #155 adds internal Session Persistence version `1`,
canonical State/content fingerprints, strict reconstruction and replay, optional
caller-supplied frozen Checkpoints with recomputed lineage, optimistic content-
fingerprint conflicts, canonical local file load, and atomic save. Session-
triggered analysis and transport are added later by Issue #157. Issue #156 adds stable
`skat_ai.api.v1.session` version `1`, exact immutable contract re-exports, public
Command parsing, ten transport-free in-memory operations, one typed Result
envelope, default-omitted complete redacted Session Provenance, strict standalone

isolated Checkpoint review export, automatic collection, all 12 Session CLI
subcommands across installed/module/Legacy invocation, explicit Position and
Historical execution, the phase-aware Assistant, six examples, and eight
append-only scenarios. The `v0.14.0` Package baseline has 85 generated outputs
and 63 authoritative and packaged Schemas. Issue #158 completed Package version
`0.14.0` and Release-documentation preparation without changing product
behavior. The maintainer subsequently published the Release manually at commit
`d5589f8`.
Online-platform adapters, browser extensions, website scraping, cloud
synchronization, distributed locking, encryption/key management, and automatic
backup policy remain open.

The published `v0.15.0` milestone provides usable manual
post-game capture of one EuroSkat 36er Standard Match from descriptive video
evidence.
Issue #160 begins it with internal Match source, timecode, tournament-format,
participant, optional statistics-snapshot, identity, perspective, and
deterministic serialization contracts. Issue #161 adds internal evidence-aware
observed Games, partial and complete Play validation, free-text Decision
commentary on any Player, linked later responses, and deterministic evidence
summaries. Issue #163 adds internal persistent 36-position Match Workspaces,
explicit passed deals, immutable changes, Progress, fingerprints, strict Resume,
and optimistic atomic local Save. Issue #164 adds internal transport-free rapid-
entry Application services with UI-ready Position Views, automatic Player and
Decision derivation, exact or bounded selectable Cards, setup updates, atomic
Play append, truncation, annotation reconciliation, and passed/clear wrappers.
Issue #165 adds the private local version-1 Web/Protocol and Capture CLI,
loopback token and same-origin protection, no-JSON creation and strict Resume,
the 36-position browser interface, packaged assets, and optimistic autosave with
explicit conflict Reload. Issue #166 adds Match-bound Snapshot editing,
deterministic IDs, strict-before-Match Context/Preparation, existing Profile
derivation, and private browser forms without policy application. Issue #167
adds internal information-safe Decision preparation, strict normal-completion
Historical materialization, unpartitioned Training source Records, and complete
36-position list construction with existing aggregation and external-lot
behavior. Issue #168 adds explicit private one-Decision Position and strict
Historical execution through the existing Application, eligible relative Profile
application through existing supported behavior, no-workflow Match
materialization, ephemeral revision-scoped reports, and authenticated canonical
loopback downloads. It completes the functional `v0.15.0` local Match Capture
milestone. Issue #169 changed only the Package version, current version
assertions, Changelog, and release-state documentation to complete Release
preparation. The maintainer published the Release manually at commit `ec1c154`,
and Issue #170 synchronizes that publication status. No Package-index or PyPI
publication is claimed. Public
Match API, Match Schema/data workflow, public/persisted Player Catalog, communication-
aware Dataset work, database/remote deployment, YouTube integration, and
EuroSkat integration remain absent. `v1.0.0` remains unready.

The published `v0.16.0` milestone is `v0.16.0 — Learning-ready behavior
and communication data`. Issues #171 through #179 implement private immutable Match
Snapshot identity, closed References, lightweight Catalogs, deterministic Corpus
persistence, strict Resume and orphan reporting, explicit Workspace import, and
persisted explicit Current-selection changes, plus a derived Current-Snapshot
Player Catalog, exact alias conflicts, retained Statistics history, and time-safe
selection, plus minimized exact human Commentary and linked Response Evidence
export, plus exact executed Decision Report Strategy Teacher Evidence with
Current-Snapshot reconciliation and canonical export, plus one Current-Snapshot-
only unpartitioned task-neutral Learning Dataset version `2` with separate
Decision State, observed behavior, Player Context, Strategy Teacher, Commentary,
and linked Response families, plus Match-group-safe deterministic partition
preparation, temporal Known-player and component-based unseen-player algorithms,
leakage audits, lossless partition indexes, and canonical export, plus private
exact-Count cross-game Match, Player, Communication, Strategy Teacher, Coverage,
Dataset Readiness, and supplied Partition Readiness summaries with deterministic
path-free export. Issue #179 completes the functional private local workflow with
the separate installed/module/Legacy `corpus` command, strict uploads, explicit
Current selection, process-local Report sources and prepared values, and seven
authenticated canonical downloads. Issue #180 changes only Package version and
current version expectations, Changelog, and Release-state documentation to
prepare `v0.16.0` without product behavior changes. The Package version is
`0.16.0`; that published baseline retains 63 authoritative and packaged Schemas,
six Session examples, 85 generated outputs, and 6,925 pytest tests. The maintainer published the
Release manually on 2026-08-18 at commit `91b1360`, and Issue #181 synchronizes
that publication status. GitHub Releases is the authoritative publication
record; no Package-index or PyPI publication is claimed.

The `v0.17.0 — Rules, Search, Coaching, and performance closure` functional
milestone is complete through Issue #196. Issue #182 closes the Claim product-
decision gate and approves one
bounded Retrospective party-wide all-remaining-Tricks Claim, and classifies every
other current Claim boundary as `not_supported_v1`. Issue #183 adds private
version-1 structured Claim, complete Evidence, exact-state, Proof Request,
preparation, assignment, diagnostic-line, and Result contracts without proof or
Runtime execution. Issue #184 adds private bounded exhaustive exact AND/OR proof
execution without Runtime behavior. Issue #185 adds private valid-proof
adjudication and existing Final Settlement composition. Issue #186 updates
Settlement Normative Matrix version `3` while preserving all 61 case IDs and
completes the approved bounded Claim and Final Settlement runtime slice through
Historical Game input only. Session, Match Capture, and Corpus Claim entry remain
open. Issue #187 defines private information-set Search World State, actor
Observation, fixed Policy, Budget, Request, Preparation, controlled-Policy, and
Result contracts. Issue #188 adds the private bounded exhaustive selected-world
best-response executor with retained-Preparation validation, fixed-player
rollout, controlled Information-set grouping, exact terminal utility, complete
contingent Policy retention, structural partial/timeout behavior, and invocation-
local memoization. Issue #189 adds strict flat `information_set_search`,
same-selection PIMC plus independently seeded Immediate retrospective comparison,
separate Historical Review and Training Dataset evaluation, safe public Results,
retained-stage Provenance, CLI, four Schemas, one example, and four generated
scenarios. Issue #190 adds strict Multi-Step and Policy Comparison integration
version `1`: fresh public-state Search with domain-separated child seeds at each
local decision, private independent coherent execution Worlds, no Search World or
Policy reuse, no-recommendation stopping without fallback, safe nested Results,
16-field diagnostics, shared-root independent comparison paths, append-once-last
ordering, stopped-row ineligibility, and retained-Result complete Provenance.
Existing `auto` is unchanged. Match Capture, Match Analysis Reports, Strategy
Teacher are integrated for the bounded one-Decision path by Issue #191 together
with Dataset-v2 and Corpus propagation. Issue #192 adds separate Information-set
Replay Coaching and Match Historical Information-set Review/Coaching with one
retained Review, no PIMC/Immediate fallback, time-safe fixed Profile Policies,
 and complete Provenance. Issue #193 adds repository-local benchmark evidence
without changing product behavior or versioned surfaces. Issue #194 adds
deterministic Historical Tactical Motif Review and private Match browser controls
without changing either Coaching family. Issue #195 reuses that exact detector
for separate Current-Snapshot-only Corpus Evidence, exact descriptive cross-game
summaries, and nine current browser downloads without changing Learning Dataset
version `2`. Issue #196 adds separate deterministic Tactical Cross-game Coaching
from exact retained Tactical/Teacher evidence, complete-Search-only consensus,
bounded repeated cross-Game focus and fixed Guidance, and a tenth current browser
download without changing Dataset version `2`. Issue #193 satisfies the bounded
v0.17.0 performance-evidence contract. Issues #182 through #196
are the frozen functional history. Issue #197 completes the documentation-only
scope and Release-readiness audit, and Issue #198 prepares Package `0.17.0` and
the Release candidate without product behavior changes. The maintainer published
`v0.17.0` on 2026-08-25 at `8187fbe`, and Issue #199 synchronizes that publication
without product functionality. Issue #200 freezes the bounded `v1.0.0` scope,
classifies all 53 required traceability rows, and records seven blockers plus the
exact #201 through #207 follow-up sequence without changing product code.
Issue #201 adds independent exhaustive official-rule evidence for R-01 and R-06
without changing product code and closes B-01. Issue #202 completes mandatory
internal load-to-final-serialization Provenance for all seven Root workflows,
makes P-10 and P-13 `satisfied`, and closes B-02 without widening public
Provenance. Issue #203 completes all nine concrete canonical Multi-Step phases,
makes P-19 `satisfied`, and closes B-03 without widening Search or public
contracts. Issue #204 applies the `AGPL-3.0-only` Package boundary and closes
B-04. Issue #205 completes the hard-cut SkatMind Package/import/CLI/resource/
Schema/identifier migration, strict legacy persisted-input support, and reviewed
historical-evidence boundary, makes P-09 `satisfied`, and closes B-08. B-09 adds
maintainer UAT outside the 53-row ledger. Issue #206 adds exact direct dependency
floors and the validation-only source/Editable/Wheel/sdist Windows/Ubuntu matrix,
makes P-34 `satisfied`, and closes B-05 after both merged Ubuntu jobs pass. Issue
#207 completes the final technical audit and closes B-06 with no material
technical blocker. Issue #208 then begins maintainer UAT; UAT-01 fails with one
accepted blocker and two accepted major findings. Issue #209 freezes the approved
unified local frontend and launch contract. Issue #210 implements the shell and
managed data home. Issue #211 adds guided Position analysis, completed-game
Review, strict optional JSON transfer, and readable process-local Results,
further partially remediating UAT-FINDING-001 without closing it. Issue #212 adds
managed Session, Match Capture, Learning Corpus, and explicit Match-to-Corpus
workflows in the unified local app. UAT-02 through UAT-12 are paused, B-09 and
B-07 remain open, and `v1.0.0` is not ready. Issue #213 implements canonical
`run`, Product-oriented top-level help, and advanced Root automation help.
Repeated UAT-01 then exposed UAT-FINDING-004: the local browser surfaces combined
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` with strict concrete-Origin mutation validation,
so browser form POSTs serialized `Origin: null` and were rejected. Issue #214
changed the unified app, standalone Capture, and standalone Corpus to
`Referrer-Policy: origin`, retained strict null/forged-Origin rejection, and
added the unified app's value-free HTML 403 response. Maintainer Microsoft Edge
verification subsequently resolved Issue #214 and UAT-FINDING-004. Repeated
UAT-01 nevertheless failed. Issue #215 freezes the authoritative future
[`bilingual profile-driven frontend UX contract`](docs/bilingual_profile_driven_frontend_ux_contract.md).
Issue #216 implements its private profile persistence, locale resolution,
strict German/English catalogs, global language selection, and bilingual common
shell foundation without completing future-owned workflow translation. Post-
merge Ubuntu CI at `087f497` reopened Issue #216 for its CPython-3.13.15 parser-
header compatibility defect and a separate stale matrix-smoke filename
expectation. The correction and both required Ubuntu jobs passed, completing
Issue #216. Issue #217 implements the grouped bilingual Home, clarified Product
concepts, related links, and stateful empty-state guidance. UAT-FINDING-001 is
implementation-remediated/open; UAT-FINDING-003 has Home, concept, and active-view
remediation implemented/open pending repeated UAT-01; and UAT-
FINDING-008 has complete German/English frontend implementation, open pending
repeated UAT-01. Issue #218 implements private safe submitted-value preservation and
localized accessible validation feedback; UAT-FINDING-006 remains open pending
repeated UAT-01. Issue #219 implements private known Players, local creation
defaults and display labels, generated frontend identities, bilingual name-first
Session/Match/Learning creation, secondary JSON transfer, and Product-first/
profile-second failure handling. Issue #220 implements task-first bilingual workflows. Issue #208
remains open, UAT-02 through
UAT-12 remain paused, B-09 and B-07 remain open, B-06 remains closed, and
Package `1.0.0` and Release preparation are not ready. No v1 Release title,
theme, date, tag, publication commit, or production model is frozen.

Current limitations include the absence of flat Position, Session, Match
Capture, and Corpus entry for the approved party-wide Claim. Its Historical-only
runtime path, private contracts, exact-state preparation, bounded proof execution,
valid-proof adjudication, public diagnostic summary, Provenance, and existing
Final Settlement reuse are implemented. Specific-
Trick Claims and the other durable v1 Claim exclusions are not supported before
v1. Other limitations include defender-open-play proof beyond five unresolved
tricks, multiple historical
continuations, historical end reasons beyond the supported bounded set,
incomplete settlement nuance, no additional preparation algorithms, algorithm
overrides, fallback or partial plans, global optimization, ratio guarantees,
Sample- or Player-count balancing, or component splitting, incomplete broader
public Provenance exposure,
heuristic rule-based recommendations and
opponent behavior, and structural rather than calibrated or tactical hidden-card
inference. Routed Search remains bounded late-game determinization subject to
Strategy Fusion, not an optimal imperfect-information policy or complete-
contract Search. The private three-Trick Information-set executor prevents
Strategy Fusion only for controlled Player `me` over its selected sequence;
exact world counts do not identify the real deal, sampled ownership is not
calibrated probability, measured timings are not latency guarantees, and timeout
activation is machine-dependent. Flat, Historical Review, and Training Dataset
evaluation routing plus strict Multi-Step and Policy Comparison integration are
implemented. Issue #191 adds the bounded one-Decision Match/Report/Teacher/
Dataset/Corpus path. Issue #192 adds separate Information-set Replay Coaching and
Match Historical Information-set Review/Coaching. Issue #193 adds separate local
benchmark evidence for the unchanged executor. Performance acceptance for v1 is
the deterministic functional and structural-work contract; supported-platform
evidence is complete under Issue #206 on Windows and merged Ubuntu CI, while
latency guarantees are not a v1 gate.
There is no
cross-decision global Policy, equilibrium, global optimality, or calibrated
probability claim. Issue #194 adds deterministic structural Historical Tactical
Motif Review without quality, intent, signaling, communication, or causal
classification. Issue #195 adds separate descriptive cross-game Tactical Motif
counts and bounded recurrence scopes without making those classifications or
changing Dataset version `2`. Issue #196 adds bounded deterministic Tactical
Cross-game Coaching from exact retained Tactical/Teacher evidence without a truth
or Player-rating claim. Overbid Null replacement selection, broader tactical
quality assessment outside retained complete-Search evidence, causal
attribution, and player ratings are not required for v1; complete internal
field-level information provenance is complete under Issue #202 without widening
the public contract. Issue #203 completes canonical Multi-Step phase coverage;
Issue #204 closes the Package-license decision with exact `AGPL-3.0-only` legal
files and PEP 639 metadata. Issue #205 completes the SkatMind rename and closes
B-08. Issue #206 completes the technical platform matrix and closes B-05 after
merged Ubuntu CI passes. Issue #207 closes B-06. Issue #208 remains open after
the original and repeated UAT-01 failures. Issue #209 freezes the initial
documentation-only remediation contract. Issue #210 implements the application
shell; Issue #211 implements guided analysis, Historical Review, JSON transfer,
and Result presentation; Issue #212 implements managed stateful workflows; Issue
#213 implements advanced CLI automation and onboarding. Maintainer Microsoft
Edge verification resolved Issue #214 and UAT-FINDING-004, but repeated UAT-01
did not pass. Issue #215 freezes the authoritative bilingual profile-driven
frontend UX contract. Issue #216 implements the private local frontend profile,
locale foundation, and bilingual common shell. Issue #217 implements the private
grouped bilingual Home information architecture, Product concepts, related links,
and useful empty states; Issue #220 completes task-first active workflows and
frontend translation. Issue #218 implements private validation preservation and
localized feedback without changing Product behavior. Issue #219 implements
private profile-driven normal creation and local Player/default/label management
without changing Product contracts. After merge and green CI, repeat UAT-01. UAT-02
through UAT-12 remain paused, B-09 and B-07
remain open, B-06 remains closed,
and Package `1.0.0` and Release preparation are not ready.
End-to-end local Live and Retrospective Session
capture is implemented through public file Save/Load, automatic Checkpoints,
accepted-Log actual-card observation, isolated review, explicit analysis, the
12-subcommand CLI, and Assistant. Issue #212 adds private unified local Session
browser operations without reopening the completed technical ledger.
Online-platform adapters, cloud synchronization, distributed locking,
encryption/key management, and automatic backup policy remain absent. The
historical published `v0.14.0` baseline
has 63 authoritative and byte-identical packaged Schemas and 85 generated-output
scenarios; the historical published `v0.13.0` baseline remains 62 Schemas and 77
scenarios. The historical published `v0.16.0` and `v0.15.0` Packages preserve
the 63-Schema, six-Session-example, and 85-scenario sets.
Match Capture now contains identity/metadata, individual evidence-aware observed
Games and commentary, persistent internal 36-position Workspaces,
transport-free rapid-entry Application services, and the private local no-JSON
browser/CLI with autosave. Match-bound Player Statistics editing and time-safe
Profile preparation are implemented. Internal Decision review preparation and
strict existing-contract Historical, unpartitioned Training-source, and complete
fixed-list materialization are implemented. Explicit browser analysis,
existing-behavior Profile application, ephemeral reports, and authenticated
local downloads are also implemented, while materialization itself executes no
workflow. Issue #191 adds strict one-Decision Information-set Search, curated
safe diagnostics, and exact source transfer without changing persistence or
public boundaries. Issue #192 adds explicit Match Historical Information-set
Review/Coaching controls and safe rendering through one Historical Application
invocation; Reports remain ephemeral and Historical Reports remain ineligible
for Strategy Teacher transfer. Public Match API/export, Match Schema/data
workflow, public/persisted Player
Catalog, public or task-specific communication Dataset workflows,
database/remote deployment, YouTube
integration, and EuroSkat integration remain absent.
Learning Corpus persistence, Workspace import, explicit Current selection, exact
Report-source transfer, Dataset-v2 preparation, summaries, and downloads are now
available through the private local `corpus` browser workflow. The derived Player
Catalog and Statistics history, Human and Strategy Teacher Evidence, Dataset-v2,
partition Results, Dataset-v2 Summary, Tactical Motif Evidence, and Tactical
Motif Cross-game Summary, and Tactical Cross-game Coaching remain process-local
and non-persisted; there is no
Public API, Schema, example, or generated scenario for Issue #195. Focused
Information-set Teacher Evidence still propagates through the existing Dataset-v2
joins and Summary counts; the separate Tactical family leaves Dataset version `2`
unchanged. Issue #196 adds the separate exact Coaching join without changing
Dataset version `2` and brings the current authenticated download set from nine
to ten.
Deletion,
garbage collection, Player Catalog or Human Evidence persistence,
persisted aliases/assertions, merge/split operations, all-revision views,
public Human or Strategy Teacher Evidence API transport, automatic Report
capture, Historical Report import, Dataset-v2 persistence, task builders,
persisted partition artifacts, and model training remain absent and are not v1
requirements. Session State itself contains no path
or fingerprint; those values belong only to the private persistence boundary.
No learned model, model-training workflow, hosted website, browser extension,
remote browser deployment, four-player support, or claim of complete official
rule coverage exists.

## Important design principles

* Keep behavior test-driven.
* Keep output regression-friendly.
* Keep JSON schemas synchronized with stable output fields.
* Keep live decision mode separate from post-game review mode.
* Preserve backward compatibility when reasonable.
* Prefer focused modules over large orchestration changes.
* Avoid broad rewrites of `main.py` unless specifically requested.
* Keep CLI output human-readable but secondary to structured JSON.
* Do not remove existing examples unless they are explicitly obsolete and covered by replacement examples.

## Current product baseline

The authoritative rules and product audit is in
[`docs/requirements_traceability.md`](docs/requirements_traceability.md). The
requirements and completion gates for `v1.0.0` are in

The implemented frontend boundary is authoritative in
[`docs/unified_local_frontend_contract.md`](docs/unified_local_frontend_contract.md),
and the implemented shell is documented in
[`docs/unified_local_frontend_application_shell.md`](docs/unified_local_frontend_application_shell.md).

Do not describe undecided future areas as permanently out of scope. Four-player
tables are the only unconditional exclusion; other candidate areas use the
classifications in `docs/v1_scope.md`.

## Safety rules for agent behavior

Do not run destructive Git commands.

Avoid commands such as:

```powershell
git reset --hard
git clean -fd
git push --force
```

Do not delete files unless the task explicitly requires it.

Do not change dependency versions unless the task explicitly requires it.

Do not introduce new dependencies unless clearly justified and approved.

## GitHub issue update comments

At the end of issue-related work, always provide a ready-to-paste GitHub issue
update comment. Do not post it.

The issue update comment should include:

* what was implemented
* changed files or areas
* checks that were run
* whether the full check passed
* whether product code changed
* whether the issue is ready to close or should remain open

## Completion criteria

The Issue-#220 implementation is documented in
[`docs/task_first_bilingual_stateful_workflows.md`](docs/task_first_bilingual_stateful_workflows.md).
The next maintainer action after merge and green exact-commit `check` and
`v1-supported-platform-matrix` is to repeat UAT-01 under Issue #208. Agents do
not perform UAT or close its findings.

A task is complete only when:

* implementation is done
* focused tests pass
* full check passes
* documentation is updated if behavior or stable output changed
* `git status` shows only intended changes
