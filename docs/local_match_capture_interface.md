# Local Match Capture interface

Issue #165 adds the first usable no-JSON interface for manually capturing one
EuroSkat 36er Standard Match. It is a private local browser transport over the
existing Match, observed-Game, Workspace persistence, and Match Capture
Application services.

## Startup

Start one server for one explicit Workspace file:

```powershell
skatmind capture --workspace MATCH.json
python -m skatmind capture --workspace MATCH.json
python main.py capture --workspace MATCH.json
```

`--workspace` is required. `--port` defaults to `0`, which asks the operating
system for a free local port; explicit ports range from `1` through `65535`.
`--no-open` suppresses automatic browser opening. There is no default path,
directory, host, remote-binding, force, authentication-disable, daemon, or
output-file option.

The Workspace parent directory must already exist. An existing file is strictly
loaded and resumed before the server starts. Invalid existing files are rejected
and never overwritten. An absent file remains absent until the browser creation
form is accepted.

These remain current standalone advanced-interface requirements. Issue #212
adds managed Match Create/Open/Resume and direct reuse of Capture operations in
the one unified app server without proxying, iframing, or starting this
standalone server as a child. `skatmind capture` and its explicit `--workspace`
contract remain supported for advanced use. See
[Application shell](unified_local_frontend_application_shell.md),
[Managed stateful workflows](unified_local_frontend_stateful_workflows.md), and
[Unified local frontend contract](unified_local_frontend_contract.md).

## Workspace creation and Resume

The creation form captures Match identity, title, game platform, external Match
ID, played time, descriptive source metadata and media bounds, three stable
Players, labels and platform IDs, and one Perspective Player. Form rows map to
`place_1`, `place_2`, and `place_3`; the Tournament Format is fixed to
`euroskat_36_standard_v1`. Initial Player Statistics Snapshots are absent and can
be added after creation.

Creation builds one revision-zero 36-Slot Workspace and atomically saves it. If
another process creates the target first, the browser reports a persistence
conflict and retains its absent context. It does not overwrite or reload
silently.

After creation or strict Resume, the interface shows the Match and source
summary, Players and Perspective, Workspace revision and Progress, and all 36
positions grouped into twelve three-position rounds. Empty, setup, in-progress,
complete-trace, and passed positions use text and border treatment rather than
color alone. The first empty position is marked explicitly.

## Metadata correction

The focused metadata form can correct only fields already supported by
`replace_match_workspace_definition_v1()`:

* title, game platform, external Match ID, and played time;
* source kind, URL, title, channel, and Match media bounds;
* Player labels and platform Player IDs.

Match ID, Tournament Format, stable Player IDs, table places, Perspective, and
loaded Statistics observations remain retained. Platform-ID and Match-time edits
leave the Snapshot unchanged. A changed non-null Player label immutably
reconciles the retained record label under the deterministic ID for that same
metadata revision. Equal content is reported as no change and does not write the
file. Existing nested timecodes are revalidated by the Workspace operation.

Changing `played_at` also recomputes every Player Statistics temporal Context and
the Match-wide Preparation in the returned browser state. It does not mutate a
Snapshot and does not add a second revision.

## Player Statistics

Issue #166 appends `set_player_statistics_snapshot` and
`clear_player_statistics_snapshot` after the original 17 Web operations while
keeping Web Protocol version `1`. Each of the three participant cards supports
Add, Replace, and confirmed Clear through ordinary HTML forms.

The editor captures an optional Snapshot ID, one shared observed/captured RFC
3339 instant, manual-entry or online-platform source details, Games played, all
eight percentages, and either no exact Counts or the complete eight-Count set.
The server derives Player ID and label from the selected participant and builds
one exact existing Opponent Statistics record through its authoritative parser.
It never corrects a submitted value or contacts a platform.

Loaded historical-aggregation Snapshots retain and display their complete source
read-only. They can be cleared or replaced with a new manual or online Snapshot;
there is no partial historical provenance editor.

Every retained Snapshot displays temporal status, eligibility, normalized
Profile, scoped Confidence, Classification, derivation status, recommended and
actionable presets, and explanations from the existing Profile derivation. Only
`source.captured_at < match.played_at` is eligible. Missing Match time, equal
instants including different offsets, and later captures remain descriptive.
Issue #168 can explicitly apply eligible Profiles through the existing Position
or Historical Application behavior. Eligibility alone does not force a policy:
the selected analysis form must enable Profile Presets, and nonactionable
derivations remain descriptive. Decision analysis remaps eligible Players to the
acting Player's left/right opponents and never binds the actor as an opponent.
Historical Profile application is limited to enabled Immediate Review; there is
no claim that Profiles alter Search Review or Replay Coaching.

## Timecodes

Browser timecode fields accept `SS`, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS`, optionally followed
by exactly three millisecond digits such as `.500`. Blank means unknown. Values
with surrounding whitespace, negative values, or minute/second components above
59 are rejected. Only exact non-negative millisecond values in
`MediaTimecodeV1` are persisted; presentation strings are not stored.

## Current position

The selected-position page shows its Match position and round, Dealer and
historical seats, Slot and capture state, Game ID, Declarer, next Player, current
Trick, completed Tricks, per-Player and total Play counts, Evidence Summary,
Card-selection scope, record blockers, and Workspace Progress.

Slot actions start a Game with the existing deterministic ID by default, mark a
Passed Deal without a synthetic Game, replace an observed Game with an explicit
Passed Deal, or clear a position after browser confirmation. Rotation,
Perspective, Game seats, and the next Player are always derived by existing
services.

## Setup

Server-rendered forms cover:

* optional Game start and end timecodes;
* unknown or exact ten-Card Perspective hand evidence;
* Declarer, Game Type, Hand, Ouvert, announcements, optional Matadors, and bid;
* unknown or exact two-Card original Skat evidence;
* unknown, known-empty Hand, or exact two-Card Discard evidence.

The setup forms render canonical local Card selectors. The server sends selected
Card codes to the existing Capture Application functions. It does not duplicate
Declaration, Card reconciliation, ownership, trace, or timecode rules and never
infers a hidden Card.

## Card entry and correction

The 32-Card play palette uses canonical deck order and displays Card code plus a
readable suit/rank label. Already played, proven unavailable, or otherwise
non-selectable Cards are disabled from the authoritative Position View. The
scope is labeled exactly as either:

```text
Exact legal cards
Observed-card candidates; ownership may be unknown
```

The bounded palette is not an ownership or legality assertion. One Card button
appends one Play. The Card-code input accepts one code or an atomic whitespace-
or comma-separated batch. An optional Decision timecode is available for a
single Card. Player and one-based Decision index are never accepted from the
browser; existing services derive both.

Play history is chronological and grouped by Decision and Trick facts. Undo last
Play is one explicit truncation to the previous count. Another form truncates to
any selected retained count. The returned authoritative Workspace removes
invalid dependent Commentary and Response Links, and the saved result notice
lists their IDs. There is no second Undo history or branch model.

The unified frontend additionally offers Issue #222's linked Trick diagnostics,
read-only partial-record warnings, single-Card retained-suffix correction preview,
and explicit rewind/removal preview. These private unified routes preserve the
standalone controls described here. See
[Match recording error recovery](match_recording_error_recovery.md).

Local JavaScript adds focus retention, `/` focus for rapid Card entry,
`Alt+U` Undo, and `Alt+Left`/`Alt+Right` position navigation. It contains no Skat
rules, Player-order or Decision-index derivation, Card legality, or Workspace
construction. Core creation, setup, Card, correction, Commentary, Passed Deal,
clear, and Reload operations work through ordinary HTML forms without
JavaScript. Successful forms use POST/Redirect/GET and retain the selected
position. Progressive enhancement follows that authoritative response, replaces
the rendered page fragment, and enhances position navigation; ordinary form
submission remains the no-JavaScript fallback. Player Statistics forms use the
same server-authoritative fallback.

## Commentary and Response Links

Commentary can reference any retained Decision, including either opponent's
Play. The subject Player is derived from that Decision. A commentator may be a
Match Player, an external name, or both. Multiline original text and an optional
timecode are retained. Existing Commentary can be edited or removed; removal
also removes dependent Response Links after confirmation.

Each Commentary item offers only later retained Decisions for Response Links.
Links can be added, replaced by their retained ID, or removed. They remain
caller-authored associations and make no causality, correctness, tactical,
signal, quality, sentiment, error, or optimality claim.

## Autosave and conflicts

Every applied browser mutation is serialized through one context lock and:

1. carries the exact expected Workspace revision;
2. invokes one existing Match or Capture operation;
3. receives one returned immutable Workspace;
4. builds at most one persistence document;
5. performs one Save with the retained content fingerprint;
6. replaces context only after persisted `saved` or equivalent `unchanged` file
   content;
7. renders the persisted state.

An unchanged operation and a Workspace revision conflict perform no Save. A
persistence conflict returns HTTP `409`, leaves the old context untouched, and
shows an explicit `Reload Workspace from disk` action. Reload strictly reads the
same fixed file. No retry, merge, force overwrite, hidden Reload, default path,
backup, or distributed lock is provided.

## Local security

The Standard Library `ThreadingHTTPServer` binds only to `127.0.0.1`. Startup
creates one cryptographically random token. The initial token URL establishes an
`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie and redirects to a token-free URL. Further
requests require the cookie; mutations also require an exact local same-origin
`Origin` whose hostname and port match Host. Missing, `null`, duplicate, forged,
malformed, credential-bearing, path/query/fragment-bearing, wrong-port, and
Host-mismatched Origins are rejected. Unexpected, missing, and duplicate Host or
Cookie headers are rejected.

The server emits no permissive CORS header, disables default request logging,
caps request bodies at 1 MiB, rejects transfer encoding and path traversal,
serves only the allowlisted packaged HTML/CSS/JavaScript resources, and emits
`no-store`, `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: origin`, frame-denial, restrictive
Content Security Policy, and restrictive Permissions Policy headers. The former
`no-referrer` policy made non-CORS browser POST Origin serialization `null` and
conflicted with the strict validator. `origin` retains a concrete request Origin
while limiting Referer to scheme, host, and port without path or query. It makes
no external network request. The browser uses no Node.js or external front-end dependency;
all assets are packaged local resources.

These controls protect the accidental local transport surface; they are not an
account system, encryption, secure storage, authenticated authorship, remote
deployment, cloud protection, or access-control claim.

## Analysis, materialization, and downloads

Issue #168 adds three explicit ordinary-HTML operations under the unchanged
private Web Protocol version `1`:

* analyze one selected prepared Decision through Immediate, bounded Search,
  `auto`, or strict Information-set Search;
* analyze one strictly materializable Historical Game with selected Snapshots,
  Immediate Review, Search Review, Replay Coaching, and/or Tactical Motif Review;
* prepare one Match-wide materialization report without workflow execution.

Decision execution works from any retained Decision whose acting own hand is
exactly preparable, including supported partial traces. The actual Card is
retrospective evidence attached after the Decision-time state, not an optimal
label. Historical execution retains the stricter complete-Deal normal-completion
boundary. Each available analysis action invokes the corresponding existing
Application workflow exactly once; normal unavailable results invoke none.
Information-set Search uses the existing Match budget-profile selector and an
explicit seed, defaulting an empty browser seed to `0`. Effective deterministic
left/right policies become fixed Search policies. Complete, partial, timeout,
and unavailable Results are retained without fallback. Its report page displays
only curated aggregate diagnostics and Card-agreement facts.
Tactical Motif Review requires no Search settings and displays only escaped
source/status totals, motif/family/player counts, chronological actual-Card motif
rows, and explicit structural/noncausal limitations. It does not display complete
hands, legal-Card sets, hidden ownership, Search Worlds, Commentary, Response
Links, or quality labels.

The materialization report shows reconciled Decision/Historical/Training counts,
fixed-list availability, standings, unresolved lot state, and the twelve round-
end Progression snapshots when available. It executes no Root workflow.

Reports have deterministic SHA-256 IDs, are scoped to the current Workspace
revision, remain process-local, and are capped at eight. Applied mutations,
Reload, and server shutdown clear them. Analysis runs outside the context lock;
if revision or content changes before publication, the stale result is discarded
with no retry.

Authenticated loopback downloads provide exact executed Root Result JSON and,
from a current materialization report, canonical materialization, Historical
collection, unpartitioned Training source, historical-list input, and list-
aggregation JSON. Downloads use deterministic ASCII-safe filenames and never
accept a server path. They may contain private Cards, Results, Statistics, and
Profile details and receive no public redaction. See
[Match analysis and exports](match_analysis_and_exports.md).

## Source links and private data

A retained source URL appears only as an explicit user-clicked link with
`target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. The interface does not embed
video, fetch metadata or thumbnails, call an API, download content, scrape a
website, or contact YouTube, EuroSkat, or another source.

The interface is an explicit private transport and may display private values in
the selected Workspace, including Player identifiers, Perspective hand, Skat,
Discards, Plays, Commentary, and Response Links. Protect the Workspace file as
private local data. Browser state and HTML omit absolute paths, fingerprints,
transport tokens, persistence JSON, internal trace structures, stack traces,
Search Worlds, and simulation ownership. Selected report pages expose curated
Analysis Results only after an explicit action; exact authenticated downloads
are private local artifacts.

Issue #179 adds one additional authenticated download only on a current executed
Decision Analysis report page: `Download for Learning Corpus`. It serializes the
complete canonical executed Decision Report into the strict private source
envelope at `/api/v1/reports/<report_id>/strategy-source.json`. Unavailable
Decision, Historical, and materialization reports expose no such link. Download
is an explicit file transfer; it does not contact, discover, or mutate a Learning
Corpus and does not persist the Report. See
[Learning Corpus browser workflows](learning_corpus_browser_workflows.md).

Issue #191 transfers exact Information-set Decision Reports through this same
version-1 envelope and route. Strict reconstruction validates the nested Request,
safe aggregate Result, comparison, and fixed-policy relationships. No new route,
download kind, automatic connection, or persistence is introduced.

## Current boundaries

Match Capture Web, Web Protocol, and Capture CLI are independent internal
version-1 contracts. `capture` is a transport command family, not an eighth Root
workflow. The historical published Match Capture Package baseline is `0.15.0`;
the historical published Learning Corpus Package baseline is `0.16.0`. The
current published Package baseline is `0.17.0` at `8187fbe`; it preserves seven
Root workflows, Public API contract version `1`, and six Session examples while
using the 71-Schema and 98-scenario baseline below.

The Issue #190 working baseline had 69 authoritative and packaged Schemas and 94
generated-output scenarios. Issue #191 changes neither count and adds only the
private one-Decision Match Information-set path and existing Corpus transfer.
Issue #192 adds Match Historical Information-set Review/Coaching, one Schema, one
example, and two scenarios. Issue #193 adds benchmark evidence without changing
those counts. Issue #194 adds Historical Tactical Motif Review, one Schema, one
example, and two scenarios. The final published totals are 71 Schemas and 98
scenarios, with six unchanged Session examples. See
[Match Information-set Search and Strategy Teacher Evidence](match_information_set_search_and_strategy_teacher.md).

Issue #168 exposes explicit private Position/Historical analysis and
materialization/download controls while preserving the no-automatic-analysis
rule and unchanged Workspace persistence. It adds no Public Match API, Match
Schema, Match JSON/data CLI workflow, Capture CLI option, or public/task-specific
Dataset workflow. Issue #179 separately adds a private local Learning Corpus and
Dataset-v2 browser without adding derived persistence, a Public API, or Schema.
Database, remote serving, cloud synchronization, encryption, backup, YouTube
integration, and EuroSkat integration remain absent. Commentary and Response
Links remain outside Search and Coaching.

Issue #168 completes the functional `v0.15.0` local Match Capture milestone.
Issue #169 completed Package/release metadata and documentation preparation
without product behavior changes. The maintainer published `v0.15.0` manually at
commit `ec1c154`, and Issue #170 synchronizes publication status. GitHub Releases
remains authoritative; no Package-index or PyPI publication is claimed.
