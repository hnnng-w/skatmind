# Public API contracts

This document defines the public Python contract introduced by Issue #137,
extended with executable facade contracts by Issue #140, and made available from
built distributions by Issue #141. The API contract version is `1`, and its
stable versioned namespace is:

```text
skatmind.api.v1
```

The public facade parses and executes all seven Root workflows through the Issue
#139 internal Application layer. Packaged schemas support Editable, Wheel, and
sdist installations without adding a workflow-specific helper or public schema
API. Issue #142 adds Package CLI entry points as a separate transport contract.
Issue #156 adds the stable in-memory Public Session API, and Issue #157 adds its
independently versioned public file-transport subnamespace plus Decision
Observation and Checkpoint review-export operations. Issue #138 remains a
separate internal field-provenance contract foundation, and Issues #143 through
#147 carry it through complete internal Root Results and bounded opt-in public
Root Result and actual-artifact provenance. Issue #202 completes mandatory
internal source-to-final-serialization enforcement around every Root execution
without adding a public export or changing this API contract.

Issue #285 is an additive Request/Result extension within Position Analysis:
`whole_game_rollout` supports explicit flat post-game review through the existing
`parse_request`, `execute`, and `serialize_result` facade. No public Python name,
Root workflow, Session exporter, or API version changes. See
[recorded whole-game review](recorded_whole_game_review.md) for its strict settings,
unavailable states, aggregate-only output, and compatibility boundary.

## Public namespaces

The supported public namespaces are:

```text
skatmind
skatmind.api
skatmind.api.v1
skatmind.api.v1.session
skatmind.api.v1.session.files
skatmind.errors
```

Only names listed by each namespace's exact `__all__` are stable. The Package
Root exports only `api`, `errors`, and `__version__`, and `skatmind.api` exports
only `v1`.
Technical importability does not make any other `skatmind.*` module public.
Direct imports from workflow, Domain, builder, serializer, schema-loader, or
other internal modules have no compatibility guarantee.

Issue #156 appends only `session` to `skatmind.api.v1.__all__`; every previous
export retains exact order and identity, and the Package Root, `skatmind.api`, and
error exports remain unchanged. `skatmind.api.v1.session` re-exports approved
immutable Session types with exact identity. Issue #157 preserves its first 52
exports and appends actual-card Decision Observation, Checkpoint review export,
and the `files` subnamespace. The in-memory API now provides 12 operations,
strict Command parsing, typed Results, optional complete Session Provenance, and
standalone Schema validation. `skatmind.api.v1.session.files` provides stable
path-free Save/Load Results while preserving strict resume, optimistic compare-
and-swap conflicts, and atomic same-directory replacement; it has no Provenance
option or default path. Existing public errors cover boundary failures, while
rejected, conflicted, unavailable, unchanged, partial, pending, and diverged
Session statuses remain normal Results. There is no Session Root workflow or
automatic analysis after every Command. See
[Public Session API version 1](public_session_api_v1.md),
[Session provenance](session_provenance.md),
[Session Decision observations](session_decision_observations.md),
[Session CLI and end-to-end capture](session_cli_and_end_to_end_capture.md),
[Interactive session contracts](interactive_session_contracts.md) and
[Retrospective Session export](retrospective_session_export.md), and
[Session Position export and Decision checkpoints](live_session_position_export.md),
and [Session Undo, correction, and Checkpoint lineage](session_undo_and_correction.md).

The internal version-1 field-level provenance language is documented in
[Field-level information provenance](field_level_information_provenance.md).
Its sidecar ledgers, coverage audits, Information Use Context, redaction, and
all-seven-workflow complete Root Result propagation remain internal. Issue #147
selects only one mapped Root Result plus actual artifacts, applies the existing
redaction helper, and recomputes complete public coverage. It does not expose
consumed-input, decision, intermediate-stage, or unredacted Application
attachments. See [Complete Result provenance](complete_result_provenance.md) and
[Public field provenance](public_field_provenance.md). The internal lifecycle is
documented in
[v1 information provenance enforcement](v1_information_provenance_enforcement.md).

The internal Application orchestration contract is documented in
[Application orchestration](application_orchestration.md). It consumes
`RequestDocumentV1` and produces `ResultDocumentV1`; the public facade is the
stable adapter over that boundary. Direct `skatmind.application` imports have no
public compatibility guarantee. Its generic dispatcher, workflow options,
injected documents, and artifacts remain internal.

## Version And Policy Constants

The version-1 constants are:

```text
PUBLIC_API_CONTRACT_VERSION = 1
PUBLIC_API_NAMESPACE = skatmind.api.v1
PUBLIC_API_COMPATIBILITY_POLICY = additive_until_v1_0
LEGACY_MAIN_COMPATIBILITY_TARGET = v1.0.0
DEFAULT_INPUT_REFERENCE_V1 = memory://skatmind/request
EXECUTION_ARTIFACT_NAMES_V1 = (opponent_statistics_input,)
PUBLIC_FIELD_PROVENANCE_VERSION = 1
PUBLIC_FIELD_PROVENANCE_ROOT_FIELD = field_provenance
PUBLIC_FIELD_PROVENANCE_DOCUMENT_SCOPES = (
    root_result_without_field_provenance,
    artifact_document,
)
```

Package version, API contract version, JSON-schema versions, and Domain contract
versions are independent dimensions. The current Package version is `0.17.0`;
API contract version `1` is not derived from it. A Package release does
not automatically increment the API contract, and an API change does not
silently rewrite JSON-schema or Domain versions. `ApiVersionInfoV1` intentionally
contains no Package version.

## Workflows

`WorkflowV1` is a string-valued enum containing exactly these Root workflows in
canonical order:

```text
position_analysis
historical_game
training_dataset
training_dataset_preparation
opponent_statistics
fixed_three_player_historical_list
fixed_three_player_historical_list_comparison
```

The values equal the existing `get_input_workflow()` results. Historical Review,
Search Review, Replay Coaching, evaluation, and audit modes remain options
inside existing Root workflows rather than separate workflows.

## Documents And Options

`RequestDocumentV1` and `ResultDocumentV1` are frozen, slotted, keyword-only
wrappers. Both contain API contract version `1`, one `WorkflowV1`, and a JSON
object document. Results also contain an immutable ordered warning tuple whose
entries must be non-empty strings.

The JSON boundary accepts only:

* objects with string keys;
* arrays;
* strings;
* integers and finite floating-point numbers;
* booleans;
* null.

Construction copies recursively. Stored objects use immutable mappings, and
stored arrays use tuples. Non-string keys, arbitrary Python objects, and NaN or
positive or negative infinity are rejected. `to_dict()` returns a fresh mutable
JSON-compatible representation of the complete wrapper.

`ExecutionOptionsV1` is a frozen, slotted, keyword-only public value with:

```text
validate_output = true
include_provenance = false
workflow_options = {}
opponent_statistics_document = null
opponent_statistics_reference = null
```

Its JSON documents and arrays are copied and stored recursively immutably.
`to_dict()` returns a fresh deterministic mutable representation. Opponent
Statistics document and reference values must be supplied together. No transport
option is accepted. `include_provenance` is a strict boolean and defaults to
`false`. `validate_output=false` disables only post-
execution Root output and artifact schema validation; Root input and Application
semantic validation always run.

Issue #202 privately retains which constructor values were explicitly supplied,
including explicit defaults, so the exact effective-option source remains
auditable. This metadata survives copy, deep copy, pickle, and
`dataclasses.replace()` but is not a sixth field, does not affect equality, and
does not appear in `to_dict()`.

The direct `workflow_options` keys map to the matching internal Position,
Historical Game, or Training Dataset Application option contract. The four
simple workflows require an empty object. Unknown, cross-workflow, transport,
invalid-type, and semantically incompatible values are rejected. Internal
Application types are not public exports. The complete key list is documented in
[Public Python API v1](public_python_api_v1.md).

`ExecutionArtifactV1` contains one recognized artifact `name` and one immutable
Root input `document`. Version 1 supports only `opponent_statistics_input`.
`ExecutionResultV1` contains API contract version `1`, one existing
`ResultDocumentV1`, an ordered immutable artifact tuple, and typed nullable
`field_provenance: FieldProvenanceBundleV1 | None`. When present, the typed value
must equal Root `document.field_provenance` and use the same workflow. Duplicate
artifact names are rejected. Its deterministic flattened serialization remains
unchanged and contains
`api_contract_version`, `workflow`, `document`, `warnings`, and `artifacts`.

The public provenance values are immutable
`FieldProvenanceAttachmentV1`, `FieldProvenanceArtifactV1`, and
`FieldProvenanceBundleV1`. The bundle has one Result attachment and provenance
only for artifacts actually returned. The seven workflow-to-Result mappings and
the `opponent_statistics_input` to
`training_dataset/opponent_statistics_input` mapping are authoritative in
[Public field provenance](public_field_provenance.md).

## Executable Facade

The additive public functions are:

```text
parse_request
execute
execute_document
serialize_result
```

`parse_request` validates the Root input schema, detects the Root workflow, and
returns an immutable defensive Request without execution. `execute` revalidates
directly constructed Requests, including API version and wrapper workflow
identity, translates public options, and executes the Application exactly once.
`execute_document` avoids duplicate Root validation and detection while matching
explicit parse-then-execute results. `serialize_result` returns a fresh mutable
flattened envelope and rejects wrong input types with
`SkatMindSerializationError`.

The facade validates Root input through packaged `input.schema.json`, Root output
through packaged `output.schema.json`, and reusable artifacts through the Root
input schema. Provenance-enabled output additionally follows strict packaged
`field_provenance.schema.json`. Validation is lazy, current-working-directory
and repository-root
independent, local-only, deterministic, and reports RFC 6901 paths. Document
failures use
`SkatMindSchemaError`, missing resources use `SkatMindResourceError`, and invalid
packaged schemas use `SkatMindInvariantError`. The backend uses
`importlib.resources` and the private `skatmind.schema_resources` Package, with no
network retrieval or concrete filesystem-path requirement. The authoritative
repository `schemas/` files and packaged resources have exact filename and byte
parity.

Existing `SkatMindError` instances pass through unchanged. Raw boundary
`ValueError` becomes `SkatMindValidationError`, and raw boundary `OSError` becomes
`SkatMindResourceError`, preserving message and cause without inventing a path.
Unexpected exceptions are not caught.

## Compatibility Metadata

`CompatibilityPolicyV1` contains this exact policy:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `policy_id` | `additive_until_v1_0` |
| `public_namespace` | `skatmind.api.v1` |
| `public_name_removal_before_v1_allowed` | `false` |
| `public_name_renaming_before_v1_allowed` | `false` |
| `additive_public_exports_allowed` | `true` |
| `direct_internal_imports_stable` | `false` |
| `legacy_main_supported_through` | `v1.0.0` |
| `package_version_independent` | `true` |
| `schema_versions_independent` | `true` |
| `deprecation_warning_name` | `SkatMindDeprecationWarning` |

`ApiVersionInfoV1` contains the API contract version, namespace, canonical
supported workflows, canonical normal Result states, and compatibility policy.
`get_api_version_info_v1()` returns a fresh, deterministic, equal immutable value
without file or schema access.

## Normal Result States

`NORMAL_RESULT_STATES_V1` is:

```text
complete
partial
timeout
unavailable
final
lot_required
not_assessable
```

These are recognized normal state values used across different workflows. They
do not form a new global Domain enum and do not replace workflow-specific
schemas. A valid Search `partial`, `timeout`, or `unavailable` result, Dataset
Preparation `unavailable` Plan, list `lot_required` status, or Replay Coaching
`not_assessable` state remains a successful Result. Malformed combinations
remain validation failures under their existing contracts.

## Public Errors

The stable hierarchy is:

```text
SkatMindError
    SkatMindValidationError (ValueError)
        SkatMindWorkflowError
            SkatMindCliUsageError
        SkatMindInformationPolicyError
        SkatMindSchemaError
    SkatMindSerializationError (ValueError)
    SkatMindResourceError (OSError)
    SkatMindInvariantError (RuntimeError)

SkatMindDeprecationWarning (DeprecationWarning)
```

Every `SkatMindError` has a non-empty human-readable `message`, a class-defined
stable `code`, and nullable `path`. Its deterministic `to_dict()` has exactly
`code`, `message`, and `path`. Codes are:

| Error | Code |
| --- | --- |
| `SkatMindError` | `skatmind_error` |
| `SkatMindValidationError` | `validation_error` |
| `SkatMindWorkflowError` | `workflow_error` |
| `SkatMindInformationPolicyError` | `information_policy_error` |
| `SkatMindSchemaError` | `schema_error` |
| `SkatMindSerializationError` | `serialization_error` |
| `SkatMindResourceError` | `resource_error` |
| `SkatMindInvariantError` | `invariant_error` |
| `SkatMindCliUsageError` | `cli_usage_error` |

Unrelated Domain code is not broadly migrated. The executable facade translates
only raw `ValueError` and `OSError` that cross its public boundary.

## CLI compatibility

Installed `skatmind`, module `python -m skatmind`, and Legacy `python main.py`
share one Package-owned CLI implementation. Issue #200 freezes Root
`python main.py` support throughout Package 1.x; removal can occur no earlier
than `2.0.0` under the deprecation policy. Issue #157 adds the same 12-subcommand
`session` family to all three forms through a separate parser, including
automatic exact Checkpoint collection, explicit Position analysis, Checkpoint-
based post-game review, Historical finalization, and the phase-aware Assistant.
Those explicit execution commands export a Session Request and invoke an
existing Application handler once; they add neither an eighth Root workflow nor
a second Console Script.

Root invocations and applicable Session subcommands accept
`--include-provenance`. Without it, Root output remains unchanged. With it, JSON
includes the corresponding public sidecar; `--quiet` suppresses successful
human-readable summaries without removing the JSON field.
`main.CliUsageError` is an exact compatibility alias for
`SkatMindCliUsageError`. Existing catches, messages, prefixes, patch points, and
argument validation remain unchanged.

The public Exit Code constants are:

```text
CLI_EXIT_CODE_SUCCESS = 0
CLI_EXIT_CODE_FAILURE = 1
CLI_EXIT_CODE_USAGE = 2
```

Normal unavailable or incomplete Results still return success. Semantic CLI
usage errors return `2`; caught input, resource, runtime, and output failures
retain `1`.

## Deprecation Policy

No version-1 public name may be removed or renamed during Package 1.x. Additive
public names and optional fields with defaults are allowed. A future removal
requires a documented replacement, a migration note, and at least one prior
published 1.x release that emits `SkatMindDeprecationWarning`; removal can occur no
earlier than Package `2.0.0`. Internal imports receive no such guarantee. No
deprecation warning is emitted now.

## Package Version

`skatmind.__version__` reports installed distribution metadata from
`importlib.metadata.version("skatmind")`. Installed and Editable distributions
report `0.17.0`; a source-only environment without distribution metadata may
report `0+unknown`. The fallback reads no repository file.

This additive Package-Root export does not change `skatmind.api.__all__`,
`skatmind.api.v1.__all__`, or `skatmind.errors.__all__`. Package version remains
absent from `ApiVersionInfoV1`, API Results, and Root JSON output. Issue #158
completed Release preparation for the functional `v0.14.0` milestone before the
maintainer's manual publication at commit `d5589f8`.

## Current Boundaries

Issue #147 implements bounded public Root Result and actual-artifact provenance.
Public exposure of consumed-input, Decision, and intermediate-stage attachments
is not required for v1. Issue #202 completes internal loading, authorized
retained-stage linkage, and final serialization enforcement across all seven
workflows. Provenance does not integrate or replace Confidence.

Issues #150 through #155 implement the internal Session contracts, deterministic
transitions, Request export, immutable pre-Play Checkpoints, history editing,
lineage, and strict persistence. Issue #156 exposes the bounded in-memory Session
surface, complete optional provenance, and standalone Schema without changing
the seven-workflow Root facade. Issue #157 adds stable public Session file
transport, accepted-Log Decision Observation, isolated Checkpoint review export,
automatic exact Checkpoint collection, installed/module/Legacy CLI parity,
explicit Session-triggered execution through the existing Application, and the
Assistant. The published `v0.14.0` baseline has 63 authoritative and packaged
Schemas and 85 generated-output scenarios; the current Package version is
`0.17.0`, while the historical published `v0.13.0` baseline remains unchanged.
Issue #205 is the one approved pre-v1 namespace break: callers migrate imports
to `skatmind`, commands to `skatmind`, and module execution to
`python -m skatmind`. There is no import shim, second CLI alias, or duplicated
public object.

Public Session GUI and browser UI, online-platform adapters, browser extensions,
website scraping, automatic cloud synchronization, distributed locking,
encryption and key management, and automatic backup policy remain absent and are
not v1 requirements. Issue #200 accepts the bounded Search, Claim, Settlement,
and Coaching contracts. Issue #202 closes the internal field-level provenance
implementation gate. Issue #203 closes canonical Multi-Step phase coverage
without adding or changing any public contract. Issue #204 applies the exact
`AGPL-3.0-only` Package metadata without changing public Python or CLI behavior.
Issue #205 completes the SkatMind public Package/import/module/CLI rename and
strict persisted-input migration boundary, makes P-09 `satisfied`, and closes
B-08. Issue #206 adds dependency metadata and validation-only installation/
platform evidence without changing any public export, field, version, error,
Exit Code, workflow identity, workflow order, or default, and closes B-05 after
merged Ubuntu CI. Issue #207 closes B-06; Issue #208 maintainer UAT is next.

Internal Application orchestration version `1`, no-I/O execution for all seven
Root workflows, legacy CLI transport parity, and auxiliary artifacts are
implemented by Issue #139. Issue #140 exposes them through the stable public
facade without adding transport I/O or provenance. Issue #141 adds distribution
metadata, private Package Resource schemas, `py.typed`, Package version export,
and Wheel/sdist clean-install gates without changing the API facade exports.
Issue #142 adds the installed and module CLI transports without changing this
Public API surface. Issue #143 adds internal live Position enforcement without
changing it. Issue #144 adds internal retrospective Position, Historical Review,
Historical Search Review, and Replay Coaching propagation without changing it.
Issue #145 adds internal Dataset, Preparation, Opponent, Profile, list, and
comparison propagation without changing it. Issue #146 completes internal
Position and Historical Result provenance. Issue #147 adds the bounded public
types, option, Root field, strict Schema, and CLI transport while preserving the
flattened API envelope and default output.
