# Match analysis and exports

Issue #168 completes the functional `v0.15.0` local Match Capture milestone by
connecting the private Match Capture browser to the existing Position and
Historical Application workflows and to the Issue #167 materialization layer.
Execution remains explicit. Capture mutations, ordinary page rendering, state
inspection, and Workspace Resume never trigger analysis automatically.

This is an internal local capability. Issue #168 itself changed no Package
version, Public API contract version `1`, seven Root workflows, 63 authoritative
and packaged Schemas, six Session examples, or 85 generated-output scenarios.
Issue #169 completed Package version `0.15.0` and release-documentation
preparation without changing this capability. The maintainer published the
Release manually at commit `ec1c154`, and Issue #170 synchronizes publication
status.

Issue #191 subsequently adds strict one-Decision `information_set_search` to
this private path, transfers its exact safe Result through the existing Report-
source envelope, and carries focused evidence into the existing Learning Corpus
workflow. It changes no existing Match contract version, operation, persistence
boundary, Public API, Schema, example, or generated scenario.

Issue #192 subsequently adds private Match Historical Information-set Search
Review and Information-set Replay Coaching controls. They use one Historical
Application invocation and one shared retained Information-set Review, preserve
the existing report lifecycle, and remain separate from one-Decision Match
Teacher transfer.

Issue #194 subsequently adds a separate `tactical_motif_review` Historical
control and safe browser projection. It executes through the same one-request,
one-invocation report lifecycle, requires no Search settings, and makes no
quality, signaling, communication, or causal claim.

## Contract identity

Issue #229 adds only a private unified navigation/presentation layer. Home's
recorded-source chooser opens the active selected Game at `/matches/review/N`;
its prepared-decision action still posts to `/matches/api/v1/analysis` and calls
`execute_unified_match_analysis_v1`. Report pages openly present their actual Game
and retained Result, with the existing downloads and same-Game recording link.
The unified adapter checks file freshness without retry or silent reload. No
Historical materialization runs on GET. Standalone transports, methods, budgets,
strict evidence and report contracts below remain unchanged. See
[Home and recorded-game review navigation](home_and_recorded_review_navigation.md).

The private version-1 contracts cover:

```text
MATCH_ANALYSIS_EXECUTION_VERSION = 1
MATCH_DECISION_ANALYSIS_OPTIONS_VERSION = 1
MATCH_HISTORICAL_ANALYSIS_OPTIONS_VERSION = 1
MATCH_ANALYSIS_REPORT_VERSION = 1
MATCH_ANALYSIS_REPORT_STORE_VERSION = 1
MATCH_ARTIFACT_EXPORT_VERSION = 1
MATCH_INFORMATION_SET_SEARCH_INTEGRATION_VERSION = 1
MATCH_HISTORICAL_INFORMATION_SET_COACHING_INTEGRATION_VERSION = 1
```

The three explicit browser operations are:

```text
prepare_materialization
analyze_decision
analyze_historical_game
```

The execution policy is one exact existing Application invocation for an
available selected Decision or strict Historical Game. Materialization prepares
existing values and executes no Root workflow.

## One-Decision Position analysis

`analyze_decision` selects exactly one retained prepared Decision by Match
position and one-based Decision index. It can execute from a partial observed
trace when Issue #167 can reconstruct the acting Player's exact current hand; it
does not require strict Historical materialization or all 30 Decisions. Normal
unavailability reports distinguish a non-observed Slot, an index not retained in
the trace, and a retained Decision that cannot be prepared.

The selected snapshot supplies only the Decision-time own hand, legal Cards,
public Trick prefix, points, public hand sizes, legitimate Skat visibility,
declared-Ouvert public hand, and relative Player mapping. It becomes one
validated nonterminal flat Position Request with
`analysis_mode = post_game_review`. The observed Card is attached only after the
visible-state cutoff as retrospective evidence. It is not an optimal label,
ground truth, Search target, hidden-ownership input, or permission to use future
opponent Cards. Commentary and Response Links are not copied into the Request.

The explicit methods are:

* `immediate_expected_value`;
* strict `bounded_search`;
* Search-first `auto` with the existing Immediate fallback semantics;
* strict `information_set_search` without fallback.

Immediate sample count and seed remain separate from the Search seed. Match
analysis accepts the immutable `interactive_v1` or `historical_review_v1` Search
budget profile, not a caller-defined budget or `evaluation_v1`. Search may
normally be complete, partial, timed out, or unavailable. An unavailable Search
inside a valid Position execution is still an executed Root Result.

Information-set Search requires the explicit Match Search seed and maps the same
two profiles to its nine existing settings. One Position Application invocation
contains Information-set Search, same-selection PIMC, independently seeded
Immediate analysis, and actual-Card comparison. The Match adapter validates safe
aggregate budgets, Candidate arithmetic and ranking, legal Cards, fixed policies,
method summary, and derived comparison facts without rerunning analysis. A
partial, timeout, or unavailable Result remains strict and never activates the
existing `auto` fallback.

The resulting Application output is schema-validated and reconciled against the
Match ID, Workspace revision, Match position, Decision index, actual Card, and
Profile binding before it becomes a report.

## Relative Profile application

Match-bound Statistics remain eligible only when `captured_at < played_at`.
For each selected Decision, eligible stable Players are remapped to the acting
Player's relative `left` and `right` opponents. The acting Player is always `me`
and is never bound as an opponent, even when that Player has an eligible
Snapshot.

When Profile Presets are enabled, an eligible and confidence-gated actionable
side Profile enters the existing Position Application policy-precedence path.
When Profile Presets are disabled, the binding may still be reported by the
private Match report, but the stable Root Profile summary is omitted. The
private report records `profile_presets_disabled`, and the existing default
policies remain effective. An eligible but nonactionable derivation records the
existing `not_actionable` reason and changes no policy. An absent or temporally
ineligible side is not injected as a bound opponent.

Profiles affect only behavior already supported by the existing Application.
They are not compatible-world weights and do not alter World selection. For
Information-set Search, the effective deterministic left/right policies after
existing Profile precedence become fixed-player policies; Profile data still
does not weight Worlds. For strict Historical Information-set Review or Coaching,
Match Statistics are also injected when Profile Presets are enabled and use the
existing time-safe per-Decision behavior to derive fixed left/right Policies.
They do not alter selected World probabilities or expose Statistics Records in
Coaching output. Existing bounded-PIMC Historical Search Review and Replay
Coaching remain unaffected by Profile settings unless independently requested
Immediate Review already uses the existing Profile path. Coaching does not
consume Workspace Commentary or Response Links.

## Strict Historical analysis

`analyze_historical_game` first applies the unchanged strict Issue #167
availability boundary. Execution requires a complete legal 30-Play trace,
Declarer and complete Declaration including bid, known original Skat, exact
Discards, and a reconstructable complete Deal. Empty Slots, Passed Deals, and
insufficient observed-Game evidence return the canonical materialization reason
without invoking Application.

For an available Game, the caller selects at least one existing mode:

* Decision Snapshots;
* Immediate Historical Review;
* Historical Search Review;
* Replay Coaching;
* Historical Information-set Search Review; and
* Information-set Replay Coaching; or
* Historical Tactical Motif Review.

Every Search Review or Coaching family requires an explicit Search seed and
accepts the same two Match Search budget profiles. Existing Search Review and
Replay Coaching form one family; Information-set Review and Information-set
Coaching form another. Modes from different families cannot be mixed. Decision
Snapshots and Immediate Review may accompany either family.

Tactical Motif Review is independent of both Search families and may run alone
or accompany either family. It needs no Search seed, Search Budget, Immediate
samples, or Profile. The Application reuses the same retained Decision Snapshot
sequence for every selected attachment rather than replaying the Game.

The complete selected configuration is passed through one Historical
Application invocation. When both Information-set Review and Coaching are
selected, the Review executes once and the same retained value produces both
attachments. Coaching alone retains that Review internally without returning the
separate Review attachment. Complete Information-set Candidates are primary
assessment evidence; same-selection PIMC and independent Immediate are diagnostic
only and never provide fallback. Partial, timeout, unavailable, or incomplete
Candidate evidence is not assessable except for a factual one-legal-Card forced
move.

The tactical report reconciles exact source Game identity, method, observation
count, and canonical chronology against the validated Root Result. Its safe view
contains source identity, complete/partial observation totals, motif and family
counts, per-Player counts, chronological actual-Card motif rows, and limitations.
It excludes complete hands, legal-Card sets, hidden ownership, Search Worlds,
Commentary, Response Links, and quality labels. Browser rendering is escaped and
runs only after explicit `analyze_historical_game`.

## Match materialization

`prepare_materialization` traverses the exact 36-Slot Workspace once and executes
no Position, Historical, Training Dataset, list, or other Root workflow. Its
revision-scoped report shows:

* occupied, empty, observed-Game, and Passed Deal counts;
* prepared and skipped Decision counts;
* strict Historical Game and unavailability counts;
* unpartitioned Training source Record counts;
* Commentary and Response Link counts as sidecar facts;
* fixed-list availability, final standings, unresolved `lot_required` Players,
  and applied external lot order;
* exactly the twelve round-end Progression snapshots when aggregation is
  available.

The prepared list reuses the existing fixed-three-player 36-position source and
aggregation contracts. The browser neither invents nor executes a random lot.
Materialization does not interpret Commentary, generate Dataset partitions or
samples, execute list comparison, or run any analysis workflow.

## Ephemeral reports and concurrency

Each report ID is a deterministic lowercase SHA-256 digest of the canonical
version-1 report identity, including its source Match and Workspace revision,
kind, selection, and value. Equal report content therefore has equal identity.
The process-local insertion-ordered store retains at most eight reports and
evicts the oldest report when a ninth distinct report is added.

Reports are not written into the Workspace or another server-side file. They are
cleared after an applied Workspace mutation, explicit Reload, or server shutdown.
Unchanged operations and revision or persistence conflicts do not clear them.
A report from a different current revision is stale and cannot be viewed or
downloaded as current.

Analysis captures the Match ID, Workspace revision, retained content fingerprint,
and private report-store generation under the context lock, then releases the
lock for potentially long workflow execution. It reacquires the lock before
publishing. If the Workspace or report-store generation changed meanwhile, the
stale result is discarded, HTTP `409` is returned, and there is no retry. This
ensures Reload or another invalidation discards in-flight work even if revision
and fingerprint alone would otherwise match. An already mismatched expected
revision also returns `409` without execution.

## Authenticated local downloads

Issue #252 places the selected unified Report's existing **Analysis Result (JSON)**
link in **Downloads for this analysis**, after normal context/recommendation/comparison
and before **Technical analysis details**. It was already outside the Report disclosure;
the new grouping and order make its purpose explicit. The technical region retains the
same minimized curated Report object. No analysis Request counterpart is invented,
and neither materialization nor Strategy Teacher sources are relabelled as Requests.

The recording page groups its existing Workspace link under **Match recording file**,
with separate **Match recording details**. Accepted expert forms, source targets,
freshness/CAS/retirement/publication and 404/409 boundaries are unchanged. The selected
Report, not another currently selected Game, owns its Result href. No extra source read,
preparation or file construction is needed to draw it. See the
[installed download evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#analysis-downloads-and-technical-details-issue-252).

Downloads reuse the existing token-established `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`
cookie and loopback Host checks. Mutation and analysis POSTs additionally retain
same-origin protection. No download accepts or exposes a server filesystem path.

An executed Decision or Historical report can download its exact existing Root
Result document. A current materialization report enables canonical JSON
downloads for:

* the complete Match materialization summary;
* the available strict Historical Game collection in Match-position order;
* the unpartitioned Training source collection;
* the existing fixed-three-player historical-list Root input, when available;
* the existing fixed-list aggregation, when available.

Exports use deterministic ASCII-safe filenames and canonical UTF-8 JSON with
two-space indentation, LF line endings, ASCII escaping, and exactly one trailing
LF. These are private browser downloads, not Public API artifacts or new Root
workflows.

Issue #179 adds one separate private transfer artifact for a current executed
Decision Analysis report. The Match Capture route
`/api/v1/reports/<report_id>/strategy-source.json` wraps the complete exact
canonical Report in source-export version `1` and uses the deterministic Decision
artifact basename plus `-strategy-source.json`. Unavailable Decision,
Historical, and materialization Reports remain unsupported. Transfer executes no
analysis and does not persist or automatically import the Report. See
[Learning Corpus browser workflows](learning_corpus_browser_workflows.md).

Issue #191 keeps this source-export version `1` and route unchanged. An
Information-set Decision source transfers the exact options, Request, Result,
comparison, Profile binding, warnings, and revision identity. Strict Resume
additionally rejects changed Search settings, invalid safe aggregates, derived
comparison contradictions, and fixed-policy inconsistencies.

## Privacy and product boundaries

Issue #251 opts the unified selected Report's existing **Card / Expected point swing /
Win rate** comparison into the same private responsive presentation as Position
Alternatives. At more than 56em of local width it is an aligned native table; at
narrow width/enlarged text its existing rows become expanded labelled Card blocks.
The named, focusable `.workflow-table-scroll` wrapper remains, but reading the tested
stacked metrics needs no horizontal scrolling. This supersedes its former 32em
minimum-width candidate limitation. All three columns, order, full names and existing
fractions/precision/unavailable formatting remain unchanged. The helper receives only
the already-curated `immediate_candidate_values`; it adds no Match Search report or
shared metric calculation. Recording/review routes currently link to retained Reports;
the explicit Report route selects the comparison. Both renderer callers share the
opt-in independently of that routing.

The real current C7/C9/C8 probe produces **11.32 / 10.83 / 9.98** point swings and
**0.9 / 0.88 / 0.87** fractions at its existing review defaults. These are retained
values, not the older export's forced expectations. B's CK, C's ten-Card historical
hand and **0/0** remain bound to Game 1/decision 2 even after another Game is selected.
Exact Report/Result/Workspace bytes survive passive views, language, native download
and resize. Existing page-snapshot preparation counts remain their baseline; pure
candidate markup adds no preparation, replay, execution or I/O. See
[installed evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#responsive-candidate-comparisons-issue-251).

Issue #241 adds the unified-only [recorded decision context](recorded_decision_context.md)
before the selected one-Decision Report's actual/recommended Card comparison. Its
typed Report and executed `profile_binding` identify the exact Game and acting/
left/right Players; only the matching accepted Match supplies labels. The existing
locked unified page snapshot projects the retained Position's full acting hand,
ordered named current-Trick prefix, contract/Declarer, next Player and known
`score_summary.total_*` points. It never borrows another selected Game's same-number
decision or its current progress score. The Game-1/decision-2 fixture shows B CK,
C next, ten C Cards including C7 and 0/0; later A C10 is excluded from this context.

Issue #246 separately displays the selected Game's complete accepted chronology
on unified review, including before any decision is ready. The current corrected
CK/C7/C10 recording shows 0 declarer points and 14 defender points, while that
earlier retained decision still shows 0/0 and only B's CK. No producer, Report,
Request/Result, download or preparation boundary changes. Read-only correction
links target existing recording rows; recovery owns all mutation controls.

This intentionally allowlists the legitimate analyzed acting hand in normal HTML.
It adds no opponent/public-hand/Skat details, Request, profile data or execution
internals. Standalone Capture state JSON, Reports, producers, canonical downloads,
analysis availability and publication/retirement remain unchanged. Executed Results
with no recommendation can still show available Position context. Only R11's
context slice is implementation-remediated; its other findings remain open.

Selected browser report pages expose curated summaries, while exact downloads
may contain private Cards, hands, Historical records and Results, Statistics, and
Profile application details. Neither reports nor downloads receive public field-
provenance redaction. Users must protect the Workspace and downloaded files as
private local data. Report IDs and Workspace fingerprints provide deterministic
identity and conflict detection, not confidentiality or authenticated authorship.

Issue #168 adds no Public Match API, Match Schema, Match Root workflow, public
Match JSON/data CLI, new Capture CLI option, persisted Workspace report, automatic
analysis, database, remote deployment, or public export contract. It does not add
Comments to Coaching, tactical interpretation, causal attribution, calibrated
machine learning, optimal hidden-information Search, complete-contract Search,
or complete official-rule coverage. Compatible-world Search remains bounded
late-game determinization subject to Strategy Fusion; sampled worlds are not
calibrated probability, and timeout behavior is machine-dependent.

Issue #168 completes the functional local Match Capture scope planned for
`v0.15.0`. Issue #169 completed Package/release metadata and documentation
preparation, and Issue #170 records the subsequent manual publication. Public
Match API and
Schema/data workflow, a public/persisted Player Catalog, public/task-specific
Dataset workflows and Dataset-v2 persistence,
database or remote deployment, YouTube and EuroSkat integration, and broader
rules, Search, Coaching, Settlement, and Provenance work were still open at that
milestone. Issue #202 later completes the required internal Root Provenance
lifecycle without changing this private Match report contract.

Issue #171's separate private Learning Corpus Match Snapshot and Catalog
contracts import no Match Analysis report and execute no analysis. Reports remain
ephemeral process-local values under this document's unchanged behavior. Derived
annotations remain separate open objects rather than Match Snapshot or Catalog
fields. Issue #176's separate in-memory Dataset version `2` also remains outside
Match Snapshot, Catalog, and report persistence. See
[Learning Corpus identity and Catalogs](learning_corpus_identity_and_catalogs.md)
and [Learning Dataset version 2](learning_dataset_v2.md).

Issue #172 persists and imports only exact Workspace Match Snapshots. It imports
no Match Analysis report, and Corpus initialization, Resume, import, and Current-
selection changes execute no analysis or materialization workflow. See
[Learning Corpus persistence and Workspace import](learning_corpus_persistence_and_import.md).

Issue #173 derives only Player, exact alias, and Match-bound Statistics history
from explicit Current Match Snapshots. It imports no report and executes no
analysis. See [Learning Corpus Player Catalog and Statistics history](learning_corpus_player_catalog_and_statistics_history.md).

Issue #174 derives a separate minimized exact human Commentary and linked
Response Evidence export from explicit Current Match Snapshots. Building or
serializing that export executes no Match Analysis, Search, Historical Review,
Replay Coaching, Profile application, or Training Dataset workflow and changes no
report or Application input. See
[Learning Corpus human Commentary and Response evidence](learning_corpus_human_commentary_and_response_evidence.md).

Issue #175 accepts caller-supplied exact executed Decision Analysis Reports as
non-persisted Strategy Teacher sources. It binds each Report to one explicit
Current Match Snapshot, rebuilds and compares one Position Request without
execution, validates the retained Result, and preserves exact Immediate/Search/
Auto method evidence plus actual-Card comparisons and Profile/policy context. It
does not change this document's Report Store lifetime, automatically capture a
Report, execute analysis, or import Historical Analysis Reports. Issue #179
supplies an explicit authenticated Match Capture download and strict manual
Corpus upload for that existing source contract while preserving the same
process-local lifetime and no-automatic-capture rule. See
[Learning Corpus Strategy Teacher Evidence](learning_corpus_strategy_teacher_evidence.md).

Issue #191 adds a focused builder-only Information-set Strategy Teacher extension
over those exact sources. It retains the safe aggregate Result and diagnostic
comparison, propagates through Dataset version `2` and cross-game method counts,
and uses the existing manual Corpus upload and seven downloads. It adds no
automatic capture or persistence. See
[Match Information-set Search and Strategy Teacher Evidence](match_information_set_search_and_strategy_teacher.md).

Issue #192 does not make Historical Reports eligible for that source transfer.
Its selected browser report view contains only curated Information-set Review
and Coaching aggregates, Key Decisions, both Turning Point types, deterministic
Guidance, and bounded Outcome Context. It omits controlled Policies,
Observations, Worlds, Exact States, hands, caches, branches, child seeds,
Statistics Records, Commentary, and Response Links. The selected-world fixed-
Policy analysis is not equilibrium, perfect play, calibrated probability, or a
global-optimality claim. See
[Information-set Replay Coaching and Match Historical analysis](information_set_replay_coaching_and_match_historical_analysis.md).

Issue #194 does not change that eligibility boundary. Tactical Motif Reports
remain revision-scoped Historical Reports and cannot be downloaded as Strategy
Teacher sources. See [Tactical motif evidence](tactical_motif_evidence.md).
