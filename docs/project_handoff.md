The project is not a machine-learning model or a full official tournament
system. It has one bounded exact-state perfect-information solver, but not a
general hidden-information Skat solver.

## Current development style

Development is milestone-based and test-driven. Each milestone is split into small parts.

Each part should:

* add one focused behavior or cleanup
* include tests
* keep existing behavior backward-compatible where possible
* run the full check script before manual review

The standard check command is:

```powershell
.\scripts\check.ps1
```

The project check currently covers:

* Ruff checks
* packaged-schema filename and byte parity
* input JSON schema validation
* generated output JSON schema validation
* Wheel, sdist, and clean-install distribution validation
* pytest regression tests

## Important assumptions

### Language

Repository code, tests, comments, docstrings, JSON keys, CLI output, and program output should remain in English.

Discussion and planning can be in German.

### Table size

The project assumes a fixed three-player Skat table.

Four-player table support is unconditionally out of scope.

### Performance rating

SkWO-style performance rating is partially implemented for fixed three-player single-game, local list-input, and explicit fixed three-player standings perspectives.

Formal series aggregation, tournament management, and official federation report
formats are not required product workflows.

### Live vs post-game mode

The project separates live decision analysis from post-game review.

`live_decision` is intended for in-game decisions and must not use post-game-only information.

`post_game_review` is intended for completed or retrospectively analyzed games.

## Major completed milestones

### Public API contract foundation

Implemented by Issue #137 for `v0.13.0`:

* stable `skat_ai.api.v1` and `skat_ai.errors` namespaces
* Package-Root exports limited to `api` and `errors`
* the exact seven-value string `WorkflowV1` contract
* recursively immutable, defensively copied Request and Result JSON documents
* immutable execution options, compatibility policy, and API-version metadata
* stable public error hierarchy, class-defined codes, and deterministic error serialization
* stable CLI Exit Code constants and exact `main.CliUsageError` compatibility alias
* additive compatibility and future deprecation policy through `v1.0.0`

Issue #140 extends this foundation with `parse_request`, `execute`,
`execute_document`, `serialize_result`, public execution artifacts and results,
direct immutable workflow options, lazy Root schema validation, and stable
boundary-error translation. Issue #141 adds installable Wheel and sdist
artifacts, private Package Resource schemas, typing and Package version metadata,
and clean-install validation. Issue #142 adds the installed and module CLI entry
points without changing Public API exports. Field-level provenance now propagates
internally through live and retrospective Position/Historical execution and all
Dataset, Preparation, Opponent, Profile, list, and comparison Root workflows,
and Issue #147 exposes the bounded redacted Root Result plus actual-artifact
subset. Issue #202 completes exact consumed-source, Information Use Context,
retained-linkage, and final-serialization enforcement around all seven Root
workflows without widening that public subset. See
[Public API contracts](public_api_contracts.md) and
[Public Python API v1](public_python_api_v1.md), and
[Public field provenance](public_field_provenance.md).

### Application orchestration foundation

Implemented by Issue #139 for `v0.13.0`:

* orchestration contract version `1` with caller-supplied input references
* frozen, slotted, keyword-only invocation, workflow-option, external-document,
  result, and auxiliary-artifact values with defensive JSON immutability
* one generic no-I/O dispatcher for all seven canonical Root workflows
* exactly five isolated Training Dataset operations: summary, partition audit,
  rolling Opponent Policy evaluation, bounded-Search evaluation, and historical
  Opponent Statistics aggregation
* optional already-loaded Opponent Statistics injection for Position Analysis
  and Historical Game execution with the existing binding and temporal rules
* one optional `opponent_statistics_input` auxiliary export artifact, separate
  from the primary result and without a transport path
* Package-owned CLI transport over the Application layer, with repository-root
  `main.py` retained as a compatibility facade preserving wrapper names, patches,
  and JSON behavior
* an internal boundary consumed by the Issue #140 public facade
* internal Issue #143 live Position, Issue #144 retrospective
  Position/Historical, Issue #145 Dataset/list/opponent, and Issue #146 complete
  Result provenance attachments
* Issue #147 public conversion selecting only one redacted Root Result plus
  artifacts actually returned, without exposing consumed-input, decision,
  intermediate-stage, or unredacted attachments

The public facade now exposes generic parse, execute, execute-document, and
serialization functions without exporting these Application types. Workflow-
specific execution helpers remain absent. Installed entry points are implemented
by Issue #142; broader Domain error migration and end-to-end field-level
enforcement remain open. See
[Application orchestration](application_orchestration.md).

  call or partial Request when unavailable

  Capture Mode, decision/trick/play indexes, actor/seat, information cutoff,
  relative map, and frozen Position Request
* replay and expected-Request equality verification without analysis,
  Application, Public API, transport, or workflow execution

Implemented by Issue #154:

* independent Session History Edit version `1` with exact Undo, correction,
  suffix, State, branching, and caller-retained-Redo policies
* immutable applied/unchanged/rejected/revision-conflict Undo Results with exact
  removed source suffixes
* revision-zero prefix reconstruction through the existing projection-level
  validator and one final Validation calculation
* immutable one-command Correction Requests and applied/unchanged/partial/
  rejected/revision-conflict Results
* deterministic original-suffix replay that stops before the first rejected
  later Command and returns exact replayed and discarded source records
* Mode, phase, trick, public-hand, Validation, and export-readiness recomputation
  from the actual active accepted Log
* immutable Checkpoint Lineage version `1` with current, ancestor, future, and
  diverged classification from exact prefix and Position Request reconstruction

  `skat_ai_session`, authoritative accepted-Log State, and caller-supplied frozen
  Decision Checkpoints in canonical order

  distinguish corrected same-revision histories and checkpoint-content changes
* strict exact-field reconstruction of persisted State, Commands, Validation,
  Position Requests, and Checkpoints, followed by full accepted-Log replay and
  both fingerprint checks

  lineage rather than persisted lineage authority

* stable `skat_ai.api.v1.session` version-1 namespace with exact immutable type
  identity, strict public Command parsing, and one typed Result envelope
* ten one-call in-memory operations covering create/apply, history edits, both
  exports, Checkpoint construction/classification, and persistence build/resume

  generated scenarios for the published `v0.14.0` total of 85

Issue #158 completed Release preparation for the functional `v0.14.0` milestone,
which the maintainer subsequently published manually at commit `d5589f8`. Issue
#212 later adds the private unified local Session browser adapter. Platform
adapters, cloud synchronization, distributed locking, encryption/key management,
and automatic backup policy remain open. See

[Session Decision observations](session_decision_observations.md), and
[Session CLI and end-to-end capture](session_cli_and_end_to_end_capture.md).

### Field-level provenance contract foundation

Implemented by Issue #138 for `v0.13.0`:

* canonical RFC 6901 JSON Pointer escaping, parsing, construction, and resolution
* frozen, slotted entries, source references, exemptions, ledgers, coverage
  summaries, and Information Use Context values
* exact-field and current-subtree coverage with deterministic JSON-leaf auditing
* complete, partial-legacy, and unavailable ledger status invariants
* same-ledger dependency, cycle, and coarse temporal monotonicity validation
* visibility- and availability-aware context-use validation
* pure engine-private public redaction and safe deterministic serialization
* explicit separation of provenance from existing Confidence contracts

Issue #143 constructs complete live decision ledgers and one partial-legacy
Position Result ledger inside Application execution. Issue #144 extends internal
propagation through flat retrospective Position Analysis, Historical Review,
Historical Search Review, Replay Coaching, and selected Position/Historical
Result branches. Issue #145 adds all five Training Dataset operations, automatic
Preparation, Opponent Statistics and Profiles, historical-list aggregation, and
independent-list comparison with complete non-legacy Root ledgers. Issue #146
completes Position/base Historical Result propagation. Issue #147 adds public
exposure only for the complete redacted Root Result and actual artifacts. See

### Core rules and simulation

Implemented:

* card notation
* card points
* trump logic
* legal-card detection
* trick winner logic
* immediate trick simulation
* expected point swing calculation
* card recommendation

### Multi-step simulation

Implemented:

* sequential player-action simulation
* configurable card-selection policy
* strict simulation context checks
* policy comparison
* result serialization
* exact nine-row canonical turn-phase classification
* preparation for empty left lead, empty right lead, and right response to an existing left lead
* same-World completion of the three former valid gaps without replaying the already played local Card
* continuation from the exact completed-Trick winner to the first new local Decision
* zero-step completion/preparation and unresolved-only `unsupported_turn_phase`
* one immutable private hidden-world root per path, owner-aware card removal, and a fixed hypothetical skat
* shared-root Policy Comparison with equal independent immutable policy-path copies
* privacy-safe coherent-world count and status summaries without hidden card identities
* strict Information-set Search with a domain-separated child seed and fresh
  public-state Search at every local decision
* safe nested Information-set Search Decisions, no-fallback stopping, and exact
  16-field compact Policy Comparison diagnostics

### Hidden-card inference

Implemented:

* hard constraints only from the local exact hand, exact public hands,
  legitimately known skat, attributed public played ownership, and confirmed
  legal failure to follow the effective Suit/Grand/Null category
* evidence beginning after the proving public play, persistent for later
  decisions, and never retroactive; current-trick use requires concrete
  leader/order
* trusted canonical attributed completed history and stricter legal historical
  replay, without guessing ownership from legacy `played_cards` or unattributed
  tricks
* immutable contradiction-checked constraints, exact DP compatible-world counts
  and marginals, and deterministic uniform labeled-assignment sampling without a
  rejection loop
* concentration-only confidence: one-owner `confirmed`, `high` from `0.85`,
  `medium` from `0.65`, and `low` below `0.65`, explicitly not calibrated
* one model and common compatible worlds for Immediate candidates, one
  compatible coherent Multi-Step root, and one shared Policy Comparison
  model/root with immutable path copies
* historical review constrained only by the visible decision prefix, current
  trick, authorized public hands, and legitimately known skat
* strict version-1 privacy-safe summaries without sampled hands/skat/root,
  actual historical hidden hands, or DP tables

The feature excludes tactical choices, declarations, profiles, concessions,
timing, future play, complete post-game hands, result, value, overbid, and
settlement evidence. It adds no behavioral, Bayesian, calibrated, learned, or
new policy model. See [Hidden-card inference](hidden_card_inference.md).

### Bounded-search contracts

Implemented in the published `v0.10.0` release baseline:

* immutable version-1 live and historical decision-time search information views
* explicit local-decision eligibility without compatible-world inspection
* deterministic requested and consumed structural budgets plus a separate wall-clock cutoff
* stable status, stop-reason, world-coverage, and solution-claim semantics
* local-side terminal utility version 1 for Suit, Grand, and Null
* privacy-safe aggregate candidate and overall result contracts
* deterministic serialization and a strict standalone Draft 2020-12 schema
* one private immutable perspective-neutral exact complete-world state with
  strict construction, canonical legal-card generation, pure transitions,
  completed-trick accounting, and neutral normal-terminal facts
* executable `perfect_information_minimax_v1` for one fully specified Suit,
  Grand, or normal non-overbid Null `ExactSearchState`, limited by the lower of
  five remaining tricks and the requested budget
* canonical full-window root values, deterministic below-root Alpha-Beta,
  invocation-local exact-only transposition reuse, and declarer-versus-
  cooperating-defenders utility orientation
* exact terminal composition through existing result, value, overbid, final
  settlement, and utility semantics
* all four Null variants with exact zero-trick declarer wins, one-or-more-trick
  defender wins, fixed-value settlement reuse, and no card-point secondary
  objective; missing or over-value Null bids stop before search
* private compatible Search-world spaces built only from the information view,
  including exact counting without void evidence, canonical bounded exhaustive
  enumeration, deterministic uniform IID sampling with replacement, retained
  duplicate accounting, strict exact-state materialization, and one frozen
  common legal-root sequence
* executable `compatible_world_minimax_v1` over that frozen sequence, using the
  same internal exact-world evaluator as direct Minimax, one global node budget,
  per-world depth reset and exact-only cache, one post-selection timeout window,
  and first-incomplete-world common-prefix stopping
* equal-weight card-identity aggregation of exact completed-world success,
  settlement score, and Suit/Grand margin, including repeated duplicate draws,
  threshold-gated partial/timeout recommendations, and privacy-safe results
* explicit flat live recommendation methods `immediate_expected_value`,
  `bounded_search`, and `auto`, with Immediate still the omitted default
* strict Search without fallback, validated Search-result-only auto fallback,
  separate Immediate/Search seeds, report separation, and privacy-safe CLI/output
* opt-in Search-aware Multi-Step with one fresh public-state Search call and
  immutable requested budget per local decision
* deterministic `multi_step_bounded_search_decision_v1` child seeds separated
  from coherent-root, opponent-action, and Immediate streams
* coherent-world separation: Search reconstructs compatible worlds from public
  state, then the selected card executes in the private path world
* Search-inclusive Policy Comparison with one appended configured method,
  eligibility-aware recommendation, and compact aggregate-only diagnostics
* flat post-game Search with an independently executed Immediate baseline,
  actual-card aggregate ranking, and Search-versus-Immediate comparison
* Historical Search Review for every actual decision with reconciled status,
  coverage, agreement, quality, and performance summaries
* stable private SHA-256 decision seeds in domain
  `historical_bounded_search_decision_v1`, derived from base seed, game ID, and
  decision index and never serialized
* bounded-Search dataset evaluation with default validation/test partitions, one
  stable global decision cap, and preservation of selected zero-decision records
* immutable `interactive_v1`, `historical_review_v1`, and `evaluation_v1`
  structural work profiles
* independent exhaustive strict-improvement fixtures for Suit, Grand, and Null,
  plus sampled convergence evidence at 32, 64, and 128 worlds
* a deterministic late-game Suit/Grand/Null benchmark corpus and measured
  performance documentation without a calibrated latency guarantee
* shared legal transition reuse by the specialized five-trick defender-open-play proof

The direct exact solver returns no partial recommendation or fallback after a
node, depth, or timeout abort. Compatible-world Minimax may recommend only from
an exact common completed prefix that reaches the configured minimum. The flat
live workflow now exposes strict Search and Search-first auto routing; auto may
mark Immediate fallback only after a valid no-recommendation Search result.
These additions remain bounded late-game determinization. Search aggregates do
not prove an optimal imperfect-information policy, sampled quality is not
calibrated, no latency guarantee exists, and omitted-method Immediate behavior
is unchanged. The stronger-search v1.0 gate therefore remains open. See
[Bounded search contracts](bounded_search_contracts.md).

### Information-set Search

Implemented in the published `v0.17.0` baseline:

* the private three-Trick selected-world controlled-Player best-response executor;
* strict flat, Post-game, Historical Review, and Training Dataset evaluation
  routing from Issue #189;
* strict Multi-Step and Policy Comparison integration version `1` from Issue
  #190;
* per-local-decision child seed domain
  `multi_step_information_set_search_decision_v1` and fresh public-state Search;
* a private coherent execution World independent of every Search selection;
* no selected-World, controlled-Policy, cache, or memoized-bundle reuse across
  decisions;
* no-recommendation stopping before local play with no fallback;
* safe executed and stopped Decisions with the existing aggregate Result nested
  beneath them;
* exactly 16 compact Policy Comparison diagnostics;
* the default four comparison policies followed by exactly one configured
  `information_set_search` row, with shared-root independent path copies;
* visible but ineligible stopped rows under unchanged ranking; and
* retained-Result complete Position provenance without rerunning Search.
* strict one-Decision Match execution through one existing Position Application,
  safe browser diagnostics, and exact revision-scoped Report-source transfer;
* focused Current-Snapshot Strategy Teacher Evidence, Dataset-v2 joins, cross-
  game method counts, and existing local Corpus workflow support from Issue #191;
* separate Information-set Replay Coaching and private Match Historical
  Information-set Review/Coaching through one retained Review and one Historical
  Application invocation from Issue #192; and
* a strict eight-case synthetic benchmark corpus, frozen functional and
  structural signatures, Strategy-Fusion and duplicate-weight diagnostics,
  focused tests, and documented local measurements from Issue #193.

Existing `auto` remains PIMC then Immediate, and no `information_set_auto`
exists. Product/runtime performance acceptance gates and latency guarantees
remain open. There is no
cross-decision global Policy, equilibrium, global-optimality, complete-contract,
or calibrated-probability claim. See [Information-set Search Multi-Step and
Policy Comparison](information_set_search_multi_step_and_policy_comparison.md)
and [Match Information-set Search and Strategy Teacher Evidence](match_information_set_search_and_strategy_teacher.md),
plus [Information-set Replay Coaching and Match Historical analysis](information_set_replay_coaching_and_match_historical_analysis.md)
and [Information-set Search performance](information_set_search_performance.md).

### Game history and scoring

Implemented:

* completed-trick structure validation
* completed-trick sequence validation
* completed-trick winner validation
* explicit and completed-trick point summaries
* game result summaries
* Schneider/Schwarz status summaries
* versioned complete normal-play historical-game records
* complete deal, pickup or Hand, discard, ownership, play-order, follow-rule, winner, point, and settlement replay validation
* exact legal prefixes and remaining-hand reconstruction for all six supported shortened terminal events
* one optional timed defender-open-play or declarer-card-exposure continuation before normal completion or one supported terminal shortening
* variable-length snapshots, review decisions, and training samples based on actual play count

### Game declaration and settlement

Implemented:

* game declaration metadata
* canonical Suit and Grand declaration dependencies
* official Suit `1..11` and Grand `1..4` matador bounds
* game value summaries for suit, grand, and null games
* automatic matador inference from known declarer cards and safe concrete-declarer completed-trick ownership where possible
* final single-game settlement summary
* supported Suit/Grand overbid detection
* supported Suit/Grand overbid settlement loss handling
* bounded impossible Null settlement from an externally supplied Suit or Grand replacement
* immutable version-3 Settlement Normative Matrix covering current support,
  bounded interpretations, legacy compatibility, one supported bounded
  Historical Claim, and durable `not_supported_v1` boundaries
* private version-1 party-wide Claim, complete Evidence, exact-state, Proof
  Request/preparation, assignment, diagnostic Move, and Result contracts
* private bounded exhaustive exact AND/OR Claim proof execution with canonical
  legal Cards, exact transitions, invocation-local memoization, and stable lines
* private valid-proof-only Claim adjudication with complete point/Trick
  assignment, preexisting-winner preservation, Suit/Grand/Null semantics, and
  existing Final Settlement composition
* focused Historical-only Claim integration with one retained replay, one
  available Proof execution, valid-only acceptance, strict diagnostic output,
  Provenance, CLI, Review/Coaching, Dataset, list, and statistics compatibility

Known remaining areas:

* full official settlement nuance coverage is not complete
* impossible Null settlement remains incomplete when the external replacement selection or its required matadors are unavailable
* matador inference does not yet reconstruct completed-trick ownership beyond safe concrete `cards` and `players` facts

### Game-end handling

Implemented:

* normal completion and legacy remaining-trick assignment
* structured declarer and defender concessions
* unanimously accepted declarer-card exposure and non-terminal exposed-hand continuation
* bounded exact defender open play for at most five unresolved tricks and non-terminal returned-hand continuation
* open-card throwing with bounded jack-only theoretical Schwarz exclusion
* preexisting-result preservation, mandatory-level handling, supported overbid settlement, and privacy-safe summaries

The approved party-wide Claim contracts, exact-state preparation, bounded proof
execution, valid-proof adjudication, and existing Final Settlement composition
are integrated through Historical Game input only. Flat Position, Session, Match
Capture, and Corpus Claim entry remain open. Specific
future-Trick Claims, defender-open-play
proof beyond five unresolved Tricks, and the other durable v1 Claim exclusions
are `not_supported_v1`; broader Settlement nuance remains incomplete.
The normative boundaries and implemented one-continuation-plus-one-terminal-
shortening historical sequence are defined in
[Settlement normative matrix](settlement_normative_matrix.md).

### Performance rating

Implemented:

* `performance_rating_system`
* partial `isko_list` support
* fixed three-player table assumption
* single-game declarer rating score
* declarer rating points
* counterparty/defender rating points
* clear distinction between settlement score and rating score
* already aggregated list or series totals via `list_performance_input`
* normalized per-game list or series contributions via `list_game_contributions`
* local generated-output-style list inputs via `list_analysis_results`
* explicit fixed three-player list standings via `list_standings_input`
* SkWO 6.3.1 shared ranks for unresolved standings ties and optional external lot order
* strict internal 36-position historical-list representation with fixed stable
  participants, passed deals, rotation, timestamp auditing, and non-cumulative
  contribution facts
* internal immutable cumulative totals, one provisional standings snapshot per
  historical-list position, final SkWO standings, unresolved ties, and optional
  exact external-lot application
* internal immutable comparison of two or more independent completed lists with
  one fixed reference, stable-ID alignment, final count and player-total deltas,
  resolved-only rank movement, and privacy-safe serialization
* public strict JSON request and output schemas for one complete list or two or
  more independent lists
* root-selected CLI execution with only `--input`, `--output`, `--quiet`, and the
  cross-workflow `--include-provenance` option, full single-list progression, and
  compact comparison presentation
* three bounded examples and generated-output scenarios for applied lot,
  unresolved all-passed tie, and resolved independent comparison

Not implemented:

* series aggregation
* tournament aggregation
* official federation report formats

### JSON schema validation

Implemented:

* `schemas/input.schema.json`
* `schemas/output.schema.json`
* focused historical-game, historical game-end/concession, historical-decision-snapshot, historical-game-review, and training-dataset schemas
* strict version-1 hidden-card inference summary schema
* strict standalone version-1 bounded-search aggregate result schema
* strict flat post-game Search, Historical Search Review, Historical Replay Coaching, and bounded-Search evaluation schemas
* strict historical-list source, request, aggregation, and comparison schemas
* strict Training Dataset preparation request, partition Plan, and preparation
  output schemas
* strict public field-provenance schema referenced from every Root output branch
* input example schema validation
* generated output schema validation
* schema validation documentation

The published `v0.12.0` baseline covers 70 deterministic generated-output
scenarios and 4,762 pytest tests. The published `v0.11.0` baseline remains
historical evidence for 64 scenarios and 4,392 pytest tests. The historical published `v0.10.0`
release baseline remains 59 scenarios and 4,075 tests, and the historical
published `v0.9.0` baseline remains 52 scenarios and 3,558 tests.

Issue #130 appends three historical-list scenarios. Issue #134 preserves those
67 scenarios and appends three automatic Training Dataset preparation scenarios,
so the published `v0.12.0` package baseline validates exactly 70 outputs without changing
the historical published baselines.
Issue #147 preserves those 70 published scenarios and appends seven public
field-provenance scenarios, one per Root workflow. The `v0.13.0` package baseline
has 62 schemas and 77 generated-output scenarios, while the published `v0.12.0`
facts remain
70 scenarios and 4,762 tests.

### Live-vs-post-game information enforcement

Implemented:

* rejects `live_decision + known_post_game`
* rejects known skat cards in `live_decision`
* rejects ended game reasons in `live_decision`
* requires `post_game_review` for ended game reasons
* rejects complete 120-point game states in `live_decision`
* restricts unverifiable completed-trick winner metadata in `live_decision`
* adds `information_policy_summary` to output
* centralizes information policy in `information_policy.py`

### Left/right opponent policies

Implemented:

* global opponent policy settings remain backward-compatible
* normalized `left_opponent_policy_settings`
* normalized `right_opponent_policy_settings`
* left/right policy input fields
* left/right policy validation
* left/right CLI overrides
* centralized CLI policy choices via `VALID_OPPONENT_CARD_POLICIES`
* left/right settings in output
* left/right settings in multi-step serialization
* left/right settings threaded into multi-step simulation
* opponent lead uses the specific left/right lead policy
* right response uses `right_opponent_policy_settings` when left leads
* profile confidence derived from `games_played`
* profile-confidence conflict resolution for cautious/aggressive preset evidence
* left/right profile-derived presets applied to effective left/right multi-step policies
* explicit side-specific CLI policy overrides applied after profile-derived presets
* shared effective opponent-policy resolver used by immediate, multi-step, and policy-comparison paths
* configured response policies applied to immediate analysis when explicitly activated
* configured response policies applied to multi-step candidate completion when explicitly activated
* sparse activated response-policy maps that preserve legacy basic/random defaults
* opponent lead policies documented as multi-step preparation behavior

Known remaining areas:

* further defender-cooperation strategy can still be improved
* deeper PlayerProfile confidence usage beyond preset selection remains future work

### Defender cooperation

Implemented:

* safe smear while preserving the partner's winning position
* avoiding overtaking a winning partner when a partner-safe legal card exists
* forced partner overtake using the lowest-point legal winning card
* equal-point forced-overtake tie-break using weakest sufficient trick strength
* winning-card selection using the lowest-point legal winner
* equal-point winning-card tie-break using weakest sufficient trick strength
* equal-point safe-smear tie-break using weakest trick strength
* narrow second-hand trump conservation on zero-point non-trump leads when only trump wins and a losing discard exists
* safer discard when the declarer is currently winning and the defender cannot win
* safer defender lead that prefers low-point non-trumps when possible

Issue #22's current heuristic and explainable defender-partnership scope is implemented.

Known remaining areas:

* defender behavior is still heuristic and assumes a fixed three-player table
* partnership inference is strongest in the currently supported second-hand path
* no complete rear-hand partnership model exists yet
* no dedicated null-game defender-partnership strategy exists yet
* no stable declarer/partner identity exists when the local player itself is only known generically as `defender`
* no full partnership/tactical plan model exists yet
* no perfect-information solving, search, machine learning, behavioral/Bayesian inference, or broader tactical hidden-card inference is used by defender cooperation

### Post-game review

Implemented:

* optional `actual_card_played` input
* actual-card validation
* legality validation for the actual card
* `post_game_review_summary` output
* comparison between actual and recommended card
* expected point swing difference
* decision quality classification
* decision factors
* decision explanation
* card-rank gap details
* CLI output for post-game review summaries
* unavailable summary when Immediate Analysis is unavailable because there is no current local decision
* information-safe pre-play snapshots for every actual play in each supported historical terminal record
* bounded review of every actual supported historical card decision through existing immediate recommendation logic
* deterministic per-decision seeds and variable reconciled game and player quality summaries

Current output fields include:

* `decision_quality`
* `decision_factors`
* `decision_explanation`
* `actual_card_rank`
* `recommended_card_rank`
* `candidate_count`
* `better_card_count`

Current CLI wording uses review-objective language for rank and better-card
summaries. For Null games, the CLI distinguishes Null contract-objective gaps
from informational card-point swing fields.

### Replay Coaching

Implemented as a `v0.11.0` information-safe public workflow:

* immutable contract version `1` with information policy
  `decision_time_then_retrospective_attachment`
* separate decision-time evidence and retrospective observed-card assessment
* normalized reuse of existing Immediate evidence, bounded-Search results, and
  Search comparisons without rerunning either analysis
* opening, middle, and endgame phase conventions
* stable statuses, evidence-basis priority, impact tiers, factors, limitations,
  strict validation, and privacy-safe deterministic serialization
* unchanged Immediate Historical Review and Historical Search Review output
* one retained chronological assessment tuple from the same Historical Search
  Review execution, without additional Search or Immediate calls
* deterministic selection of at most five strictly-below-best Key Decisions by
  impact, evidence, positive primary gap, alternative count, and chronology
* separate Contract-success decision-opportunity and first recorded-prefix
  outcome Turning Points
* complete-normal-play fallback for still-undecided terminal contracts, including
  a ten-trick Null declarer win without a declarer trick
* threshold-free high-impact classification, stable factors and limitations,
  strict game-level reconciliation, and deterministic internal serialization
* one-game player, role, phase, and contract patterns requiring two occurrences
* separate actionable and descriptive pattern contracts with canonical counts,
  ordering, factors, limitations, and deterministic serialization
* one fixed-template recommendation per Key Decision and at most five ranked,
  evidence-deduplicated actionable pattern recommendations
* explicit Contract-success, settlement-score, Suit/Grand-margin, Null, Immediate-
  only, and Search-versus-Immediate wording boundaries
* one retained internal guidance result from the same Historical Search Review
  execution without additional Search or Immediate calls
* complete report version `1` and method
  `historical_replay_coaching_v1`, composed from that retained analysis
* privacy-safe player/game context, separately attached final outcome context,
  reconciled coverage, and zero-preserving player/role/phase/contract summaries
* explicit `final_context_after_coaching` isolation, deterministic internal
  serialization, canonical report limitations, and no private deal or Search
  state in report output
* opt-in `--historical-replay-coaching` with explicit Search seed and the shared
  immutable Search/Immediate settings
* coaching-only conditional JSON output and combined one-pass emission with the
  retained Historical Search Review summary
* strict standalone Draft 2020-12 schema registered from the main output schema
* concise human-readable Key Decision, Turning Point, recommendation, scope,
  outcome-context, and limitation sections
* normal Grand, Null, and continuation-before-shortening generated-output
  coverage within the exact 64-scenario matrix

The observed card is not ground truth, no causal final-outcome claim is made,
and exhaustive compatible-world aggregation remains subject to Strategy Fusion.
Issues #194 and #195 now provide separate deterministic structural Tactical
Motif detection and descriptive cross-game Counts. Stronger Search, tactical
quality outside retained complete-Search Teacher evidence, broader interpreted
Coaching, and causal language remain unimplemented. Issue #196 provides the
separate bounded deterministic Tactical Cross-game Coaching slice. See
[Replay coaching contracts](replay_coaching_contracts.md).

### CLI and workflow usability

Implemented:

* improved CLI help text and command discoverability
* optional `--quiet` mode for automation-friendly JSON-output runs
* generated-output validation for representative user-facing CLI workflows
* comparison-only policy-comparison CLI output handling
* CLI sample-bound validation fixes
* curated documentation walkthroughs for common workflows
* complete historical-game validation and summary output
* optional historical decision snapshot and complete-review flags
* separate versioned training-dataset conversion workflow
* installed `skatmind`, module `python -m skatmind`, and Legacy `python main.py`
  invocation forms over one canonical Package parser and transport
* exact `--version` output, invocation-specific help, unchanged Exit Codes, and
  clean-install CLI/API parity

## Release status

Current published stable and latest stable GitHub Release: `v0.17.0`.

Current Package version: `0.17.0`.

Current Package baseline: published `v0.17.0`.

Published Release theme: "Rules, Search, Coaching, and performance closure".

Published GitHub Release title: "v0.17.0 — Rules, Search, Coaching, and
performance closure".

Historical `v0.16.0` Release theme: "Learning-ready behavior and communication data".

Historical `v0.16.0` GitHub Release title: "v0.16.0 — Learning-ready behavior and
communication data".

Published Release commit: `8187fbe684559f9c0c2ba444be1bf33950359ad2`
(`8187fbe`).

Publication date: 2026-08-25.

The Package requires Python `>=3.13` and retains Public API contract version `1`,
exactly seven Root workflows, and the one
`skat-ai = skat_ai.cli:main` Console Script. The current published baseline has
Settlement Normative Matrix version `3` with 61 cases, 71 authoritative Schemas,
71 Packaged Schema Resources, six Session examples, 98 generated outputs, ten
private Corpus prepared downloads, and 7,479 passing pytest tests in 921.96s.
GitHub Releases is the authoritative publication record; no Package-index or
PyPI publication is claimed.

The historical published `v0.16.0` baseline at `91b1360`, published on
2026-08-18, has 63 authoritative and packaged Schemas, six Session examples, 85
generated outputs, and 6,925 passing pytest tests in 1083.48s. Functional Issues
#171 through #179 implement that milestone, Issue #180 completed Release
preparation, and Issue #181 synchronized publication status without product
functionality.

The published `v0.17.0` functional history uses Package version `0.17.0`, Python
`>=3.13`, Public API contract version `1`, seven Root workflows, one Console
Script, and six Session examples. Issue #186 updates the Matrix to version `3`
with the same 61 cases. Issue #189 adds four Information-set Search Schemas, one
example, and four generated-output scenarios. Issue #190 adds strict Multi-Step
and Policy Comparison integration, one example, and two scenarios without a new
Schema, bringing the working totals to 69 authoritative and packaged Schemas and
94 scenarios. The published `v0.16.0` counts above remain unchanged Release
facts.

Issue #191 adds private one-Decision Match Information-set Search, exact Report-
source transfer, focused Teacher Evidence, Dataset-v2 joins, Summary counts, and
existing Corpus workflow support without changing those counts.

Issue #192 adds one strict Information-set Replay Coaching Schema, one Root
example, and two append-only scenarios after that 69/94 Issue #190 baseline. The
Issue #192 point-in-time totals are 70 authoritative and packaged Schemas and 96
scenarios. Package/API/workflow/Console-Script/Session baselines and Settlement
Matrix version `3` with 61 cases remain unchanged.

Issue #193 adds a deterministic synthetic Information-set Search benchmark
corpus, a strict repository-local runner and focused tests, and documented local
reference measurements. It changes no production code, Schema, route, profile,
Public API, Package version, example, generated scenario, or working count.

Issue #194 adds one strict Historical Tactical Motif Review Schema, one Root
example, and two append-only scenarios. The final published totals are 71
authoritative and packaged Schemas and 98 scenarios. Package/API/workflow/
Console-Script/Session baselines and Settlement Matrix version `3` with 61 cases
remain unchanged.

Issue #195 adds private Current-Match-Snapshot-only Tactical Motif Evidence,
explicit skips, exact descriptive cross-game summaries, atomic process-local
Corpus preparation, minimized presentation, and two authenticated downloads. It
changes no Package/API/workflow/Console-Script/Schema/example/generated-scenario/
Session/Dataset-v2 baseline, so the published totals remain 71 Schemas and
98 scenarios.

Issue #196 adds private deterministic Tactical Cross-game Coaching, exact
Tactical/Teacher joins, retained exact and semantic Teacher accounting,
complete-Search-only repeated cross-Game focus, bounded fixed Guidance, atomic
third-family Corpus publication, minimized aggregate presentation, and one tenth
authenticated download. It changes no Package/API/workflow/Console-Script/
Schema/example/generated-scenario/Session/Dataset-v2 baseline, so the current
working totals remain 71 Schemas and 98 scenarios.

Issue #197 records the documentation-only scope and Release-readiness audit.
Issue #198 changes only Package metadata, current version expectations,
Changelog, and Release-candidate documentation. The maintainer subsequently
published `v0.17.0` on 2026-08-25 at `8187fbe`, and Issue #199 synchronizes that
publication without product functionality. Issues #182 through #196 are the
functional milestone; Issues #197, #198, and #199 add no product functionality.

Historical published `v0.15.0` Release theme: "Local EuroSkat 36er Match
capture, analysis, and exports".

Historical GitHub Release title: "v0.15.0 — Local EuroSkat 36er Match capture,
analysis, and exports".

Historical Release commit: `ec1c154`.

The historical `v0.15.0` baseline contains 63 authoritative Schemas and 63
Packaged Schema Resources, six Session examples, 85 generated-output scenarios,
and 6,510 passing pytest tests. Issues #160 through #168 implement its functional
milestone, Issue #169 completed Release preparation, and Issue #170 synchronized
publication status after manual maintainer publication.

Historical published `v0.14.0` Release theme: "End-to-end Live and Retrospective
Session capture".

Historical GitHub Release title: "v0.14.0 — End-to-end Live and Retrospective
Session capture".

Historical Release commit: `d5589f8`.

The historical `v0.14.0` baseline contains 63 authoritative Schemas and 63
Packaged Schema Resources, six Session examples, 85 generated-output scenarios,
and 5,892 passing pytest tests. Issues #150 through #157 implement its functional
milestone, Issue #158 completed Release preparation, and Issue #159 synchronized
publication status after manual maintainer publication.

The historical published `v0.16.0 — Learning-ready behavior and communication
data` Package milestone is functionally complete through Issue #179's private local
Learning Corpus/Dataset-v2 workflow. Issue #180 changed only Package version,
matching expectations, Changelog, and Release-state documentation to complete
Release preparation without product behavior changes. The Package retains 63
authoritative and packaged Schemas, six Session examples, 85 generated outputs,
and 6,925 pytest tests. The maintainer published the Release manually on
2026-08-18 at commit `91b1360`, and Issue #181 synchronizes publication status.
No Package-index or PyPI publication is claimed.

The `v0.17.0 — Rules, Search, Coaching, and performance closure` functional
milestone is complete through Issue #196. Issue #182 closes the Claim product-
decision gate, and
Issue #183 adds private structured Claim and exact-proof contracts plus one
untraversed exact-state preparation. Issue #184 adds private bounded exhaustive
exact AND/OR proof execution. Issue #185 adds private valid-proof adjudication
and existing Final Settlement composition. Issue #186 updates Matrix version `3`
without changing its 61 cases and completes the approved bounded Claim and Final
Settlement runtime slice through Historical Game input only. All other current
Claim boundaries remain durable v1 exclusions. Session, Match Capture, and Corpus
Claim entry remain open. Stronger information-set Search
and Strategy Fusion mitigation now include Issue #187's private contracts and
Issue #188's bounded selected-world controlled-Player executor. Issue #189 adds
strict flat routing, same-selection PIMC plus independently seeded Immediate
retrospective comparison, separate Historical Review and Training Dataset
evaluation, safe public Results, retained-stage Provenance, CLI, Schemas, an
example, and generated scenarios. Issue #190 adds strict Multi-Step and Policy
Comparison integration with fresh per-decision Search, safe Results/diagnostics,
no fallback, existing ranking, and complete Provenance. Match Capture, Match
Analysis Reports, and Strategy Teacher are integrated for the bounded one-
Decision path by Issue #191 together with Dataset-v2 and Corpus propagation.
Issue #192 adds separate Information-set Replay Coaching and private Match
Historical Information-set Review/Coaching with retained Review reuse,
complete-Candidate primary evidence, diagnostic PIMC/Immediate without fallback,
time-safe fixed Profile Policies, and complete Provenance. Issue #193 adds
repository-local benchmark evidence without changing production behavior.
Issue #194 adds deterministic Historical Tactical Motif Review, exact structural
lead/void/Trick-control/Defender-partnership/hand-shape/outcome evidence, shared
Snapshot reuse, complete Provenance, strict Root Schema and CLI, and private
Match browser controls. It does not add tactical quality assessment, intent,
signaling, communication, or causality. Issue #195 reuses the same exact detector
for separate Current-Snapshot Corpus Evidence and descriptive cross-game Counts,
including bounded recurrence scopes, without adding those interpretations or
changing Learning Dataset version `2`.
Issue #196 adds separate deterministic Tactical Cross-game Coaching from exact
retained Tactical and Teacher evidence. It preserves every exact Report, counts
semantic duplicates once per Decision consensus, treats only unanimous complete-
Search evidence as focus-eligible, requires at least two qualifying Decisions in
at least two Games, retains at most five fixed-Guidance focus areas per Player,
and keeps zero-count Players in Catalog order. It executes no analysis and makes
no truth, perfect-play, Player-rating, intent, communication, causal, or
significance claim.
Issue #193 satisfies the bounded v0.17.0 performance-evidence contract. Issue
#200 accepts deterministic functional/structural performance for v1, classifies
latency guarantees and broader tactical/Rating work as not required, and retains
broader internal Provenance as a blocker. Issue #202 subsequently closes that
blocker without widening public Provenance. Issues #182 through #196 are the
frozen functional history. Issue #197 completes the documentation-only audit,
and Issue #198 prepares Package `0.17.0` and the Release candidate without
product behavior changes. The maintainer published `v0.17.0` on 2026-08-25 at
`8187fbe`, and Issue #199 synchronizes that publication without product
functionality. Issue #200 freezes the bounded `v1.0.0` scope and exact #201
through #207 sequence. Issue #201 adds independent exhaustive official-rule
evidence for R-01 and R-06 without product-code change and closes B-01. Six
blockers B-02 through B-07 remained at that point. Issue #202 makes P-10 and P-13
`satisfied`, closes B-02, and leaves five blockers B-03 through B-07 at that
point. Issue #203 completes all nine concrete canonical Multi-Step phases, makes
P-19 `satisfied`, and closes B-03 without widening Search or public contracts.
Four blockers B-04 through B-07 remained at that point. Issue #204 applies exact
`AGPL-3.0-only` legal files and PEP 639 metadata and closes B-04. Issue #205
completes the hard-cut SkatMind identity and migration boundary, makes P-09
`satisfied`, and closes B-08, while B-09 adds maintainer UAT outside the 53-row
ledger. Issue #206 adds exact direct dependency floors, resolved source/Editable/
Wheel/sdist evidence, minimum Wheel/sdist evidence, and separate Windows/Ubuntu
matrix execution. It makes P-34 `satisfied` and closes B-05 after both merged
Ubuntu jobs pass. Issue #207 closes B-06 with no material technical blocker.
B-09 and B-07 remain. Issue #208 then starts maintainer UAT; UAT-01 fails with
one accepted blocker and two accepted major findings. Issue #209 freezes the
initial unified local frontend and launch contract. Issues #210 through #213
implement the shell, guided Analyze and Review, managed Session, Match, and
Learning workflows, and advanced CLI onboarding. Repeated UAT-01 then exposes
UAT-FINDING-004, and Issue #214 implements its browser-Origin policy correction.
Maintainer Microsoft Edge verification resolves Issue #214 and
UAT-FINDING-004. Repeated UAT-01 nevertheless fails. Issue #215 freezes the
authoritative
[bilingual profile-driven frontend UX contract](bilingual_profile_driven_frontend_ux_contract.md),
and Issue #216 implements its private profile/localization foundation and
bilingual common shell. The Issue #216 correction and both required Ubuntu jobs
passed. Issue #217 implements the grouped bilingual Home, Product concepts, safe
related links, and useful stateful empty states. UAT-FINDING-001 is further
partially remediated/open; UAT-FINDING-003 has its Home and concept remediation
implemented through active workflows/open pending repeated UAT-01; UAT-FINDING-008 has
complete bilingual frontend coverage/open pending repeated UAT-01. Issue
#218 implements private safe form-state preservation and localized accessible
validation feedback. UAT-FINDING-006 has its implementation complete but remains
open pending repeated UAT-01. Issue #219 implements private known Players,
generated frontend identities, saved creation defaults and display labels,
bilingual name-first Session/Match/Learning creation, secondary JSON transfer,
and Product-first/profile-second persistence semantics. Issue #220 implements
task-first bilingual active workflows. Repeated maintainer UAT-01 failed again
on September 11, 2026, including inaccessible actionable review after 30 Session
Plays. Issue #221 adds direct review of saved own-decision snapshots, exact
source-labelled process-local Results, and existing retained downloads. Issue #208
remains open, UAT-02 through
UAT-12 remain paused, B-09 and B-07 remain open, B-06 remains closed, and
Package `1.0.0` and Release preparation are not ready.

Historical published Package milestone: `v0.15.0`, providing usable manual post-
game capture of one EuroSkat 36er Standard Match from descriptive video evidence.
Issues #160 and #161 implement the internal immutable Match identity/metadata and
observed single-Game/commentary foundations. Issue #163 adds persistent internal
36-position Workspaces. Issue #164 adds internal transport-free rapid-entry
Application services over those Workspaces. Issue #165 adds the private local
browser/Capture CLI with loopback security and optimistic autosave. Issue #166
adds Match-bound Snapshot editing and time-safe Profile preparation. Issue #167
adds internal Decision preparation and strict Historical, unpartitioned
Training-source, and complete fixed-list materialization without workflow
execution. Issue #168 adds explicit one-Decision Position and strict Historical
Application execution, existing-behavior eligible Profile application,
no-workflow Match materialization, deterministic max-eight revision-scoped
reports, concurrency invalidation, and authenticated canonical local downloads.
It completes the functional milestone. Issue #169 updated only the Package
version, matching assertions, Changelog, and release-state documentation to
complete Release preparation. The maintainer published `v0.15.0` manually at
commit `ec1c154`, and Issue #170 synchronizes that publication status.

Issues #118 through #124 complete the functional `v0.11.0` milestone, and Issue
#125 completed release preparation. Publication was performed manually by the
maintainer. GitHub Releases is the authoritative publication record.

The published `v0.12.0` package baseline implements the immutable
historical-list source, cumulative aggregation, independent comparison, and
strict public JSON/schema/CLI workflow, plus internal version-1 unpartitioned
dataset-preparation and supplied split-plan contracts plus deterministic
temporal Known-opponent and Player-disjoint unseen-player assignment generators.
Issue #134 adds the root-selected public preparation workflow, strict schemas,
CLI, and three examples. The prior 67 scenarios are unchanged, and that
historical published baseline validates 70 while the historical published
`v0.11.0` baseline remains 64. Issue #135 completed release preparation before
manual maintainer publication.

Issue #137 is the first implemented `v0.13.0` foundation. It adds API contract
version `1`, exact public exports, immutable JSON Request and Result wrappers,
compatibility metadata, stable errors, and unchanged legacy Root CLI behavior.
It changes no Package version, schema, workflow execution, example, or generated
scenario.

Issue #138 adds the internal version-1 field-level provenance language,
immutable sidecar ledger, deterministic coverage and dependency validation,
Information Use Context, public redaction, and safe serialization. It changes no
Package version, public API export, schema, workflow output, CLI, example, or
generated scenario. Subsequent Issues #143 through #147 add the bounded workflow
and public propagation described below.

Issue #143 adds internal Application provenance version `1` and live-analysis
provenance version `1`, complete decision-time enforcement for flat and simulated
live Position selection, aggregate-only Search and structural inference mapping,
and exact partial-legacy Position Result coverage. It changes no Package version,
public API export, Root output, schema, CLI, example, or generated scenario.

Issue #144 adds retrospective-review and Replay Coaching provenance version `1`,
separates pre-actual and post-actual Position/Historical stages, reuses retained
Immediate and Search values, covers requested review and report summaries, and
adds exact partial-legacy Historical Result coverage. It changes no Package
version, public API export, Root output, schema, CLI, example, or generated
scenario.

Issue #145 adds four focused internal propagation versions, complete non-legacy
Root ledgers for Dataset, Preparation, Opponent, list, and comparison workflows,
and retained-stage Feature/Target, audit, rolling, Search, split, Profile, Entry,
progression, standings, lot, and comparison provenance. It changes no Package
version, public API export, Root output, Schema, CLI, example, or generated
scenario.

Issue #146 adds complete Result provenance version `1`, replaces the Position
and Historical partial-legacy Root ledgers with complete non-legacy mappings,
adds a result-only bundle for base Historical execution, and enforces
forward-only scoring, Result, Settlement, Performance, list, replay, event, and
terminal dependencies with private-proof-safe redaction. It changes no Package
version, public API export, Root output, Schema, CLI, example, generated
scenario, or established workflow call count.

Issue #147 adds public field-provenance version `1`, Root field
`field_provenance`, document scopes `root_result_without_field_provenance` and
`artifact_document`, immutable public attachment/artifact/bundle contracts, seven
explicit Result mappings, and the actual `opponent_statistics_input` to
`training_dataset/opponent_statistics_input` mapping. Existing-helper redaction
is followed by complete recomputed coverage. Public API
`ExecutionOptionsV1.include_provenance` defaults to false, while all three CLI
forms accept `--include-provenance` with concise or quiet behavior. The strict
Schema raises the eventual `v0.13.0` resource count to 62; seven append-only
scenarios raise the eventual `v0.13.0` matrix to 77. Package version and
published `v0.12.0` evidence remain
unchanged at the Issue #147 boundary. Issue #148 sets Package version `0.13.0`
and completes Release metadata and current-state documentation preparation
without product behavior changes.

Issue #139 adds internal Application orchestration version `1` for all seven Root
workflows, five isolated Training Dataset operations, injected Opponent
Statistics, auxiliary artifacts, and legacy CLI parity. Issue #140 adds the
executable public facade over that boundary, lazy Root schema
validation, direct immutable options, public artifacts and execution results,
and stable boundary errors. Neither issue changes Package version, Root schemas,
examples, generated scenarios, or provenance output.

Issue #141 adds explicit Setuptools build metadata, private Package Resource
schemas with exact authoritative parity, `py.typed`, Package-Root `__version__`,
Wheel and sdist inspection, separate clean installations, external-working-
directory API smoke tests, and local/CI distribution gates. It changes no
Package version, Root schema meaning, workflow, generated scenario, legacy CLI,
or provenance output, and it does not publish an artifact.

Issue #142 adds installed CLI contract version `1`, the exact `skat-ai` Console
Script, `python -m skat_ai`, one Package-owned canonical implementation, the
Legacy Root facade, `--version`, and Wheel/sdist clean-install CLI/API parity. It
changes no Package version, Root schema, example, generated scenario, Provenance
output, or publication state.

  and prepared existing/Tactical/Coaching artifacts, no-JavaScript forms,

  public contracts

## Current high-priority limitations

* Historical records support normal completion or one of six terminal shortenings, optionally after one timed continuation kind. The approved party-wide Claim has Historical-only runtime integration, strict public diagnostic output, and downstream Review/Dataset/list/statistics support. Multiple non-terminal events, arbitrary event streams, specific future-Trick Claims, and the other durable v1 Claim exclusions are `not_supported_v1`; other end reasons remain unsupported.
* Historical opponent-statistics aggregation and rolling policy evaluation support normal completion and all six shortened terminal reasons; other end reasons remain unsupported.
* Flat Position, Session, Match Capture, and Corpus Claim entry, concession
  disputes, and broader Settlement completeness remain incomplete.
* All seven Root workflows have complete internal Root Result provenance,
  including base Historical execution. Bounded public Result and actual-artifact
  exposure is implemented. Issue #202 completes internal consumed-source,
  retained-stage, context, and final-serialization enforcement; consumed-input,
  Decision, intermediate-stage, unredacted, binding, and checkpoint attachments
  remain intentionally unavailable through the public contract.
* Evidence-constrained sampling does not infer the real deal or provide exhaustive search.
* Hidden-card inference beyond confirmed structural decision-time evidence and
  general stronger Search remain incomplete. Issue #187 defines private
  three-Trick information-set World State, actor Observation, deterministic fixed-
  Player Policy, Budget, Request, Preparation, controlled-Policy, and Result
  contracts. It preserves ordered Compatible-world selection and sampled
  duplicate weight and prevents conflicting actions for equal controlled-player
  Observations. Issue #188 adds the private bounded executor with fixed-player
  rollout, equal-Observation grouping, exhaustive canonical controlled actions,
  existing exact terminal utility and Candidate ranking, complete contingent
  controlled Policies, conservative partial/timeout Results, and invocation-
  local World and ordered-bundle memoization. Issue #189 routes strict flat
  Information-set Search and adds descriptive same-selection post-game,
  Historical Review, and Training Dataset evaluation. Issue #190 adds strict
  Multi-Step and Policy Comparison integration with per-decision Search isolation
  and unchanged `auto`. Issue #191 adds the bounded one-Decision Match/Report/
  Teacher/Dataset/Corpus path. Issue #192 adds separate Information-set Replay
  Coaching and Match Historical Information-set Review/Coaching. Issue #193 adds
  repository-local benchmark evidence and satisfies the bounded v0.17.0
  performance-evidence contract. Issue #200 accepts deterministic functional and
  structural-work evidence for v1; cross-machine latency guarantees are not v1
  requirements. Issue #206 adds the required CPython 3.13 Windows/Ubuntu
  installation evidence and closes B-05 after green merged Ubuntu CI.
  Compatible-world Minimax evaluates the frozen selected
  sequence and aggregates one exact common prefix, but it is determinization-based
  and subject to strategy fusion. Neither method is an optimal imperfect-
  information policy proof. Overbid Null replacement selection remains outside
  both methods.
* The immutable fixed-three-player 36-position historical-list contracts now
  include Passed Deals, cumulative aggregation, progression, final SkWO
  standings, unresolved ties, exact external-lot application, and independent-
  list comparison with one reference and no series rollup. Public workflows
  now expose the retained contracts through strict schemas, root-selected JSON,
  concise CLI output, three examples, and privacy-safe generated-output coverage.
  Series aggregation, ratings, tournament management, and official reporting
  remain outside this bounded workflow.
* Automatic Training Dataset preparation now derives the fixed
  `temporal_known_opponent_v1` or
  `component_balanced_unseen_player_v1` algorithm from mode. A complete result
  losslessly materializes the existing version-1 dataset and audit; an
  unavailable result succeeds with explicit null dataset/audit and no partial
  Plan. The request has no algorithm field or default weights, and the CLI has no
  algorithm overrides or fallback. Its transport options and cross-workflow
  provenance opt-in do not affect assignment. Plan/CLI presentation is card-free.
  The complete nested reusable dataset retains source cards.
  Additional algorithms, algorithm overrides, fallback or partial Plans, global
  optimization, ratio guarantees, Sample- or Player-count balancing, component
  splitting, model training, and automatic evaluation remain unsupported.
* Replay Coaching has a public version-1 one-game report with information-safe
  evidence, impact, prioritization, patterns, recommendations, scope summaries,
  and isolated outcome context. Separate Historical Tactical Motif Review adds
  deterministic structural evidence without changing Coaching. Issue #195 adds
  separate exact descriptive cross-game Tactical Motif Counts and recurrence
  scopes from Current Match Snapshots. Issue #196 adds bounded deterministic
  cross-Game focus from unanimous retained complete-Search Teacher evidence.
  Tactical quality beyond that exact evidence, broader interpreted cross-game
  patterns, Player Ratings, and causal attribution remain unimplemented and are
  not v1 requirements; broader Search is post-v1.
* Immutable Live and Retrospective Session contracts plus deterministic
  Command application, replay, phase advancement, projection, incremental
  validation, readiness, canonical Retrospective Historical and information-safe
  Position Request exports, declared-Ouvert public-hand capture, and immutable
  pre-Play Decision Checkpoints are implemented. Immutable strict-prefix Undo,
  one-command correction, first-rejection suffix replay, valid partial corrected
  States, and Checkpoint lineage are also implemented. Private deterministic
  persistence now stores the authoritative State and caller-supplied frozen
  Checkpoints, strictly reconstructs and replays them, recomputes lineage, and
  uses content-fingerprint conflict checks plus canonical atomic file replacement.
  Stable Public Session and file APIs, actual-card Decision Observation, isolated
  review export, automatic Checkpoint collection, all 12 CLI subcommands,
  explicit Position/Historical execution, the Assistant, examples, and generated
  outputs are implemented. Export-only operations execute no workflow, and the
  reusable Application still has only seven Root workflows. Issue #212 adds the
  managed Session browser, and Issue #219 adds profile-driven name-first creation
  with generated private identities without changing the Public Session or file
  APIs. Online-platform adapters, cloud synchronization,
  distributed locking, encryption/key management, and automatic backups remain
  absent.
* Opponent behavior and confidence remain heuristic and rule-based; behavioral evaluation does not prove stronger play.
* No learned model or model-training workflow exists.
* Match Capture contains identity/metadata, evidence-aware observed Games and
  commentary, persistent internal 36-position Workspaces, transport-free
  rapid-entry Application services, and the private local browser/Capture CLI
  with autosave. Match-bound Player Statistics editing and time-safe Profile
  preparation are implemented. Internal Decision preparation and strict
  Historical, unpartitioned Training-source, and complete fixed-list
  materialization are implemented. Explicit one-Decision and Historical
  Application execution, existing-behavior eligible Profile application,
  no-workflow materialization reports, and authenticated local downloads complete
  the functional `v0.15.0` local milestone. Reports are ephemeral and Commentary
  does not enter Coaching. Public Match API/export, Match Schema/data workflow,
  public/persisted Player Catalog, public/task-specific communication Dataset
  workflows, Dataset-v2 persistence/task builders, database/remote deployment,
  YouTube integration, and EuroSkat integration remain absent. No
  hosted website, remote browser deployment, browser extension, or online-
  platform adapter exists.
  Issue #191 adds strict one-Decision Information-set Search, safe aggregate
  diagnostics, and exact source transfer without changing report persistence or
  public boundaries.
  Issue #192 adds strict Historical Information-set Review/Coaching controls and
  safe rendering through one existing Historical Application invocation.
  Historical Reports remain ineligible for Strategy Teacher source transfer.
* Issues #171 through #179 provide private Learning Corpus source identity, exact
  Match Snapshots, closed references, Catalog entries/current selections,
  deterministic fixed-root persistence, strict Store Resume and orphan reporting,
  pure Catalog mutation, strict Workspace import, and persisted selection
  changes, plus a derived exact Player Catalog and time-safe Statistics history
  and separate minimized human Commentary/linked Response and method-bound
  Strategy Teacher Evidence exports plus one Current-only unpartitioned,
  task-neutral Learning Dataset version `2` plus Match-group-safe deterministic
  partition preparation and leakage audits, plus descriptive cross-game Match,
  Player, Communication, Strategy Teacher, Coverage, and readiness summaries,
  plus one private local workflow for strict source upload, explicit Current
  selection, exact preparation, minimized inspection, and canonical download.
  Strategy Teacher sources accept only exact
  executed Decision Analysis Reports, rebuild no-execution Requests, validate
  retained Results, and make no optimality or preferred-Teacher claim.
  Issue #191 adds focused Information-set Teacher Evidence through those exact
  sources and carries it through existing Dataset-v2 joins, Summary counts, and
  the historical Issue #179 seven-download chain without derived persistence.
  Issue #195 separately reuses the exact Tactical detector over Current Match
  Snapshots, represents every observed Decision as Evidence or an explicit skip,
  builds exact global/Player/scope/distinct-Game/distinct-Match/recurrence Counts,
  and atomically publishes two additional process-local artifacts for nine
  current authenticated downloads. Human, Strategy Teacher, and Tactical
  Evidence remain separate, and Learning Dataset version `2` is unchanged.
  Issue #196 adds a separate Coaching join and report over those exact retained
  values, atomically publishes a third prepared family, and adds a tenth current
  authenticated download. Exact Teacher Reports remain distinct, semantic
  duplicates count once per Decision consensus, only unanimous complete-Search
  below-best evidence can create repeated cross-Game focus, and every Player
  Catalog entry receives one bounded Report. Dataset version `2` remains
  unchanged, and no Coaching artifact is persisted or made public.
  Deletion, garbage collection, recovery UI, persisted aliases/assertions,
  merge/split operations, all-revision Player views, Human Evidence persistence
  and public transport, Strategy Teacher persistence and public transport,
  Dataset-v2 persistence, task builders, persisted partition artifacts, derived
  artifact persistence, automatic Report capture, Historical Report import, and
  public exposure remain absent and are not v1 requirements. Database deployment,
  evaluation, and Ratings beyond the accepted bounded contracts are not v1
  requirements; remote/cloud/collaboration and model training are post-v1.
* The product supports fixed three-player tables only; four-player tables are unconditionally out of scope.

## Next recommended action

Issue #215 freezes the authoritative
[bilingual profile-driven frontend UX contract](bilingual_profile_driven_frontend_ux_contract.md).
Issue #216 implements the private local frontend profile, locale foundation, and
bilingual common shell, and its post-merge Ubuntu parser and matrix-smoke
corrections passed both required jobs. Issue #217 implements the private grouped
bilingual Home information architecture and Product-concept guidance. Issue #218
implements canonical registered form metadata, rejected-submission state
separate from accepted workflow/Product state, bounded safe-value preservation,
localized accessible contextual feedback, and successful PRG. Issue #219,
"Reduce setup friction with generated IDs, known-player selection, and saved
defaults," is implemented in [Profile-driven stateful
creation](profile_driven_stateful_creation.md). Issue #220 implements task-first
bilingual workflows. Repeated maintainer UAT-01 failed again on September 11,
2026. Issue #221 addresses only direct review of recorded own Session decisions:
saved checkpoints, deterministic variant selection, accepted actual Cards, frozen
Requests, exact context/file/attempt guards, and source-labelled retained Results.

Maintainer Microsoft Edge verification resolved Issue #214 and
UAT-FINDING-004. Repeated UAT-01 nevertheless failed. Issue #208 remains open;
UAT-02 through UAT-12 remain paused; B-09 and B-07 remain open; B-06 remains
closed; and Package `1.0.0` and Release preparation are not ready. No v1 Release
title, theme, date, tag, or publication commit is frozen.

The implemented current frontend remains documented in
[Unified local frontend contract](unified_local_frontend_contract.md),
[Guided analysis and Results](unified_local_frontend_guided_analysis_and_results.md),
[Managed stateful workflows](unified_local_frontend_stateful_workflows.md), and
[Advanced CLI automation](advanced_cli_automation_interface.md). The Issue #216
foundation is documented in [Local frontend profile and localization](local_frontend_profile_and_localization.md),
and the Issue #217 slice is documented in
[Bilingual Home information architecture](bilingual_home_information_architecture.md).
Issue #218 is documented in
[Frontend validation state and localized feedback](frontend_validation_state_and_localized_feedback.md).
Issue #219 is documented in [Profile-driven stateful
creation](profile_driven_stateful_creation.md).

Issue #220 is documented in [Task-first bilingual stateful
workflows](task_first_bilingual_stateful_workflows.md). Issue #221 is documented
in [Review recorded Session decisions](session_recorded_decision_review.md).
Issue #222 adds [Match recording error recovery](match_recording_error_recovery.md):
typed trace diagnostics, derived partial-record warnings, linked accepted Trick
history, retained-suffix single-Card previews, explicit rewind effects, and exact
source/CAS Apply. Synthetic late-completion coverage does not reproduce the
unavailable original maintainer trace. UAT findings remain open.
Issue #223 implements direct native Deutsch/English selection, semantic error-page
return routes, regenerated transport fields, and bounded exact-source/form draft
restoration. Real returned-form tests recover from duplicate-Player creation
errors; real #221/#222 and Learning artifact tests retain source-bound state without
execution. The baseline normal Learning sequence did not reproduce inversion.
Edge 152.0.4191.66 native-click checks covered both languages at desktop/narrow
sizes with JavaScript enabled/disabled. Its Learning panel contrast and narrow German
Match transfer/settings observations are preserved as historical visual evidence. See
[Local frontend profile and localization](local_frontend_profile_and_localization.md)
for preservation limits, conflict semantics, and sanitized temporary evidence.
This is implementation evidence, not maintainer UAT acceptance.
Issue #224 implements [Unified workflow visual contract](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md):
one app-owned theme, explicit 36-entry tile structure, shrinkable expanded forms,
light Learning states and a labelled keyboard-scroll Report table. Baseline Learning
panel contrast was 1.14:1 and is now 15.93:1; the German 390-pixel Match page changed
from 503 to 375 document pixels. A real installed-Wheel Edge run covers 280 page
measurements, native recovery/continuation, explicit Learning preparation/downloads
and source-safe language changes. The optional repeatable script is separate from
the full check. Standalone styling and Product contracts remain unchanged.
Issue #225 implements [Settings and Player seat setup](settings_and_player_seat_setup.md):
dedicated Settings, compact lossless Player editing, exact removal/account previews,
one own identity with explicit seat choice, reviewed named rosters, corrected
game-1/table-place Match translation, and unchecked limited profile enrichment.
Real HTTP/persistence coverage checks every own seat and all roster/rotation
permutations; installed Edge checks create Session/Match recordings with JavaScript
enabled/disabled. Earlier About/preferred-perspective/default-saving choices are
explicitly revised, while legacy data and #221–#224 behavior remain supported.
Issue #226 implements [Compact Card entry](compact_card_entry.md): shared native
set/single-Play controls, canonical candidate-first Session append with N ordinary
revisions and one save, unchanged Match evidence replacement, truthful availability,
exact-source binding, and recording focus. Real HTTP tests reach ten-Card saves,
partial reopen, grouped Skat/discards, 30 Plays and reopened #221 review, plus Match
evidence/recovery. Installed-Wheel Edge evidence checks de/en, JavaScript on/off,
320-pixel/200%-text reflow, zero selection POSTs and one ten-Card save POST. It is a
bounded implementation slice and does not close unrelated UAT findings.
Issue #227 adds [Recorded Trick progress](recorded_trick_progress.md): immutable
accepted public-Play prefixes, individual captured points/won Tricks and separate
known-party totals. Session uses its retained replay; Match enhances #222's exact
anchored history. Null, incomplete/shortened ends, unresolved warnings and actual
correction/rewind outcomes retain their scope. Real HTTP tests and 176 installed-
Wheel Edge measurements cover recording, totals, correction, language and reflow.
It partially remediates C6 without a new route, persisted counter, analysis, final
scoring or whole-frontend acceptance. Catalogs now contain 1,318 matching keys.
The #227 [validation follow-up](recorded_trick_progress.md#validation-blocker-follow-up)
preserves both unsuccessful full attempts (each 8,480 passed, 1 skipped, 1 failed).
It bounds standalone Corpus rejected-POST delivery/cleanup and makes the real
public-provenance additive test clock-deterministic, with 18 new regressions.
The affected eight-module run passed 175 tests and three fresh-process target
runs passed 9 tests each. Original socket packet-level causation and the original
provenance differing field are not retrospectively established. Final local
complete-check output and exit status are recorded in the accompanying report;
the successful final-tree check is mandatory. Existing installed-browser evidence
remains bound to its September 13 feature build. #227 remains open until that
local gate and both exact-merged-commit CI jobs pass.
Both required jobs, `check` and `v1-supported-platform-matrix`, must pass on the
exact merged commit. A future focused retest can open a recorded Game, review an
earlier own decision after 30 Plays, recognize its comparison and source, then
reopen and review the saved decision again. This does not request another complete
walkthrough now. Implementation does not close UAT findings or reopen #220/B-06.

Issue #228 implements [Compact Game declaration](compact_game_declaration.md):
shared visible bid entry, four explicit native checkbox choices, optional bounded
Matador help, exact-source forms and accepted-only summaries. Canonical rule and
information restrictions, historical Session correction, Match no-op/clear and
#221–#227 Result/recovery/progress lifecycle remain authoritative. The current
registry has 57 routes/97 definitions and catalogs have 1,375 keys. Real HTTP tests
and installed-Wheel Edge 153 de/en/script/no-script saves, correction, errors,
language, reopen and 320-pixel/200%-text evidence are documented with actual height
tradeoffs and hashes. Both exact-merged-commit jobs remain required for #228;
this bounded slice does not resolve #208 or the remaining metadata, knowledge,
timezone and Home/Learning findings.

Issue #229 implements [Home and recorded-game review navigation](home_and_recorded_review_navigation.md):
five concise Home tasks, normal recorded-source selection, strict fresh-context
reuse, existing #221 Session review and open selected-Game Match analysis/Reports.
Legacy manual Review drafts/Results and explicit source-switch invalidation remain.
The private registry is 58 POST routes/98 definitions; catalogs have 1,414 keys.
Real returned-form tests and 272 installed-Wheel Edge measurements cover both
languages/script modes, source-labelled Results/downloads, errors, and 320-pixel/
200%-text reflow. Historical orientation panels and Home Product-card choices are
explicitly superseded. Both exact-merged-commit jobs remain closure gates; #208,
unresolved UAT findings, B-09/B-07, and paused UAT-02–12 remain unchanged.

Issue #230 adds [Saved time zones and local time entry](local_time_entry.md): an
independent Settings preference, native optional local date/time entry for Match
creation/update and Session metadata/correction, exact-source gaps/folds, and
original-string Keep/Replace/Remove. It intentionally adds optional
`interface_preferences.time_zone` and `tzdata>=2026.4` (minimum 2026.4); old profile
bytes remain exact, but older builds may reject the extended shape until explicitly
cleared. Packaged data is IANA 2026d in local evidence, with no host TZPATH required.
Real returned-form/persistence tests and 128 installed-Wheel Edge measurements cover
both languages/script modes, native inputs, errors, saves and reopen. Current counts
are 59 private POST routes/103 forms/1,462 catalog keys. Profile-only changes retain
#221 Requests/Results and temporal eligibility; real edits retain existing
invalidation. Package 0.17.0, public/Product contracts and 98 outputs remain.
This is partial remediation: exact merged-commit `check` and
`v1-supported-platform-matrix` remain required; #208/unresolved findings remain
open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open, B-06 closed, Release unready.

Issue #231 implements [Direct Session Card start](session_direct_card_start.md):
setup/deal immediately offers known initial Cards, with optional Game details in
the existing secondary area. Creation remains revision zero. A missing-ID normal
initial batch composes one ID-only Command plus N Cards before one atomic save;
existing-ID batches retain N revisions. Exact prefixes/checkpoints, timestamp text,
Undo/reopen, explicit local time and #221 review remain intact. Focused coverage
has 52 new tests; the 957-test affected-path run passed. The Card route now enforces
its existing declared 8,192-byte bound before preparation. Installed-Wheel Edge 153
evidence covers de/en, script/no-script, direct saves, errors, language, optional time and
320-pixel/200%-text reflow; the successful initial path uses one mutation POST after
creation instead of two. Counts remain 59 routes/103 forms, with 1,463 catalog keys.
#229/#230 are closed completed prerequisites after maintainer-confirmed CI. Exact
merged-commit `check` and `v1-supported-platform-matrix` remain required for #231;
#208/unresolved findings stay open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open,
B-06 closed, Release unready. Complete final-check results accompany the report.

Issue #232 clarifies the [fixed Match recording scope](settings_and_player_seat_setup.md#issue-232-fixed-recording-scope-evidence):
normal creation/setup/errors and metadata use 36 positions including passed deals
with three fixed Players, independently of descriptive platform and observation
source. Optional Technical details retain the exact EuroSkat registry identity.
It explicitly supersedes #219's normal format label; canonical format, platform
mapping/defaults, source, seats, time entry and Product persistence are unchanged.
Real HTTP creation/update/reopen tests and installed-Wheel Edge 153 de/en/native
evidence cover the slice, including 320 pixels/200% text. Counts remain 59 routes,
103 forms and 98 outputs; catalogs have 1,464 keys. #231 remains completed. Both
exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual closure; #208/unresolved findings remain
open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open, B-06 closed, Release unready.

Issue #233 implements [knowledge-based Session entry](session_knowledge_based_entry.md):
native perspective (`live`, during or after a Game) and complete-reconstruction
(`retrospective`, all three initial hands plus original Skat) choices, accepted-mode
labels, named direct-deal help and scoped Historical blockers. Ended recordings use
eligible saved-decision review without promotion. Specialist promotion remains
one-way, fact-free and phase-preserving with normal Result invalidation. #231's
eleven-Command/one-save first hand, exact time, frozen Requests and #232 remain intact.
The 1,153-pass affected-path run has one existing Windows symlink-permission skip;
88 installed-Wheel Edge measurements cover both locales/script modes, native saves,
complete reconstruction, ended review and 320-pixel/200%-text reflow. Counts remain
59 routes/103 forms/98 outputs, with 1,474 matching catalog keys. #231/#232 remain
completed; both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #233 closure. #208 and
unresolved findings remain open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open,
B-06 closed. No complete UAT or release readiness is claimed.

Issue #234 adds [Unplayed Cards after complete recording](unplayed_card_summary.md):
one private guarded deck-complement projection and compact bilingual Session/Match/
focused-review presentation. Exactly thirty accepted Plays and ten completed Tricks
yield original Skat for Hand or discards for non-Hand, including Null. Original Skat,
recorded evidence, capability flags, earlier Requests, #227 totals and specialist
editors retain their source meanings. Corrections recompute; 30-to-29 removes the
conclusion. Real HTTP execution/download/save-count regressions and 240 installed-
Wheel Edge measurements cover both languages/script modes and narrow/enlarged text.
Package/contracts/dependencies and 98 outputs remain; no route or form is added.
Final complete-check output accompanies the report. #233 remains completed; both
exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #234 closure. #208/unresolved findings stay
open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed.

Issue #235 adds [permanent managed recording deletion](managed_recording_deletion.md):
available Session/entire-Match list and chooser actions, one named unchecked
confirmation, exact single-use 30-minute selections, strict file rechecks, and
private active-context retirement. Profile bytes/dormant labels, unrelated work and
independent Corpus copies remain. The private registry is 62 POST routes/106 forms;
catalogs have 1,508 keys. Synthetic HTTP/filesystem tests and 224 installed-Wheel
Edge measurements cover native de/en/script/no-script deletion and source safety,
including 16 real removals and corrected narrow/enlarged confirmation reflow.
The operation is new; public/Game/persistence formats, dependencies and 98 outputs
remain. Final full-check native output/exit evidence accompanies the report, and
both exact merged-commit CI jobs remain closure gates. #234 remains completed;
#208/unresolved findings stay open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open,
B-06 closed. No maintainer UAT or release readiness is claimed.

Issue #236 adds [direct saved-Match Learning entry](learning_direct_match_entry.md):
an initially unselected native Match choice, guarded saved-source capture without
activation, exact target/discovery binding, fixed `keep_current`, precise version
outcomes, explicit Build and View results with coverage. The two new private routes
bring the registry to 63 POST routes/107 forms; catalogs have 1,529 keys. Partial,
empty and passed input, independent copies after #235 deletion, genuine unrelated
Results/recovery, canonical import/CAS/orphans and all ten downloads are covered by
real-file/HTTP regressions. Installed-Wheel Edge 153 evidence has 144 measurements
across de/en, scripts on/off and narrow/enlarged controls. Final complete-check
native output/child exit accompanies the report. Package 0.17.0, Python >=3.13,
AGPL-3.0-only, dependencies including tzdata>=2026.4, profile/source/public formats,
and 98 outputs remain. #235 stays completed; both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate
manual closure. #208/unresolved findings stay open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused,
B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed; no maintainer UAT or release-readiness claim is made.

Issue #237 adds [source-bound rejected Session Card explanations](session_card_feedback.md)
on the two normal Card routes. A bounded private witness distinguishes accepted
assignment/ownership, used/Skat/discard Cards, exact-hand membership and proven
follow-suit; visible native links inspect exact accepted hands or Plays. Original
accepted facts remain separate from candidate progress, full labels are rendered
in the selected language, and exact source/language/retirement gates remain. The
registered Play body limit is now actually enforced at 8,192 bytes. Thirty-four
focused tests and 320 installed-Wheel browser measurements cover real rejection,
unchanged bytes/checkpoints/Results, source inspection and valid continued saves.
Final full-check output/child exit accompanies the report. No public/persistence,
palette, core-rule, dependency, Package or output changes are introduced. #236 stays
completed; both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate #237 closure. #208/unresolved
findings remain open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open, B-06 closed.

Issue #238 implements [Match Game navigation and recording focus](match_game_navigation.md):
compact truthful progress and selected Game/round/named seats/controls precede one
native 36-entry/twelve-round overview. Game/Spiel replaces ordinary Position labels;
tiles, explicit first-unfinished continuation and normal creation target the named
recording region. The unchanged suggestion can point backward and does not advance
selection or save. Match error language returns retain native summary focus before
generic recording focus; same-Game Report/preview lifetime and real-switch invalidation
remain. Twenty-seven new regressions and 176 installed-Wheel measurements compare
the actual clean starting HEAD `dd98181` with the implementation, including de/en,
script/no-script, 320 pixels/200% text, real saves, review and rewind. Final complete-
check native output/child exit accompanies the report. Package 0.17.0, dependencies,
profile/public/Product formats, registry counts and 98 outputs remain. #237 stays
completed; both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate #238 closure. #208/unresolved
findings remain open, UAT-01 failed, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open, B-06 closed.

Issue #239 remediates #208 retest R09 through the shared private Position Result
Summary: known points read retained `score_summary.total_declarer_points` and
`total_defender_points`, preserving supplemental inputs and decision-time ownership.
Real Session recording/review, completion/reopen, de/en defensive-value regressions
and installed-Wheel native browser checks verify 14/29 and unchanged downloads.
See [Session decision review](session_recorded_decision_review.md). #238, including
the unified rejection-transport correction, remains completed. Exact merged-commit
`check` and `v1-supported-platform-matrix` were its exact-commit closure gates;
#239 remains completed.

Issue #240 implements R10's exact equal-best Immediate explanation in fresh producer
text and retained shared Position presentation. It preserves the representative,
singleton flags, stable order, ordinal ranks, metrics, review quality, #239's 14/29
and #238 transport. Old Results/Reports/Teacher exports remain exact; fresh text and
its content-derived identities legitimately change. Real HTTP, strict consumer and
installed-Wheel de/en/script/no-script evidence is in the
[Session review guide](session_recorded_decision_review.md). Both exact merged-commit
CI jobs remain #240 closure gates. R11 and other unresolved #208 findings remain
open; UAT-01 is unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. Package,
dependencies, schemas, persistence and 98 scenarios remain; no release claim follows.

Issue #241 implements only R11's visible pre-Card context in saved Session Results
and executed Match decision Reports. The shared private immutable projection reads
the retained Position hand/prefix/turn/contract/totals and exact source-bound names/
indexes, under existing capture locks. Session reuses #239 scores and #240 ties;
Match uses its Report binding rather than another Game's decision row. Real HTTP,
completion/reopen, passive byte/count checks and independent-Wheel bilingual/narrow
browser evidence are in [Recorded decision context](recorded_decision_context.md).
#240 remains completed. Both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #241 closure;
#208 and remaining R11/UAT findings remain open. UAT-01 is unaccepted, UAT-02–12
paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. Producer bytes, Package, dependencies,
formats and 98 scenarios remain unchanged; no release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #242 repairs only R02's new Session/Match own assignment: initial own seat
remains unset, native select-state presentation derives a free own row immediately,
and exact saved-own repetition is adopted idempotently during Update. Genuine
occupants, independent duplicates and distinct explicit accounts remain lossless
conflicts. Exact reviewed Create, manual C perspective with own A, Game-1 mapping,
rotation, local time/knowledge choices and Product-first lifecycle remain. Evidence
and account rules are in [Settings and Player seat setup](settings_and_player_seat_setup.md).
The clean starting HEAD is `dc7b8f575b111be267993c5677181c1008df74f5`; #241 stays
completed. R08 and residual R11 remain separate. Both `check` and
`v1-supported-platform-matrix` must pass on the exact merged implementation commit
before manual #242 closure. #208/other findings remain open, UAT-01 unaccepted,
UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #243 repairs only R08 through app-owned CSS: coherent action-state pairs,
explicit spaced Session Result focus and wrapper-independent Match peer disclosures.
Installed before/after evidence, native review/error/preview-cancel focus, exact
retained bytes and the unchanged narrow-table limitation are documented in the
[unified visual contract](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#r08-action-focus-and-disclosure-repair).
Starting HEAD is `2af0e7af73980862140b1bc46cab9b099feedaf4`; #242 remains completed.
Both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #243 closure. #208 and other findings
stay open, UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed.
This is scoped styling evidence, not maintainer UAT or release-readiness approval.

Issue #244 implements only R03's Session/Match task/readiness composition. One
existing primary task replaces the three-panel instruction stack; zero observations,
insufficient evidence, prepared decisions and retained Results remain distinct.
Saved decisions and visible Results remain independent of current/full-Historical
readiness, including the ended 14/29 SJ case. Specialist controls and Match-side
Learning transfer are secondary native disclosures with visible relevant feedback.
Starting HEAD: `8f0211f76e59fbbb1026c147b4b0e99825c28943`. See the
[task-first guide](task_first_bilingual_stateful_workflows.md) and
[scoped browser evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#r03-recording-task-composition).
#243 remains completed. Generic operation notices and other R03/UAT work remain
open; exact merged-commit `check` and `v1-supported-platform-matrix` gate manual
#244 closure. #208 stays open, UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open
and B-06 closed. Package, dependencies, formats, 63 routes/107 forms and 98 scenarios
remain; no release-readiness or whole-UAT claim follows.

Issue #245 implements only R03's contextual operation-feedback lifecycle, starting
clean on `bug/245-operation-feedback` at `018237c100f99b766e146bfd424feb49beb28018`.
One immutable source-bound receipt per active family is separate from retained
outcomes, expires after 60 monotonic seconds and is delivered once at final matching
HTML. Native feedback is untimed; the optional eight-second idle display pauses for
hover/focus/hidden documents. Errors, partial correction, profile-unsaved creation,
transfer and retained-version/preparation warnings stay explicit. See the
[validation guide](frontend_validation_state_and_localized_feedback.md#completed-operation-receipts-issue-245)
and [independent-Wheel evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#r03-contextual-operation-feedback).
#244 remains completed. Both exact merged-commit `check` and
`v1-supported-platform-matrix` gate manual #245 closure. #208/other findings remain
open, UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. No
release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #246 implements only R05's recorded-history/party-score presentation, from
clean HEAD `24a20d7a03729b365078e827610336170259d487`. One shared Game score reads
existing party prefixes; one accepted chronology omits individual cumulative grids.
Selected Match review exposes its Cards even with zero prepared decisions. Null
states recorded declarer-Trick facts without points or an invented outcome. Exact
anchors, recovery actions, #238–#245 and historical analysis context remain intact.
The synthetic ended Session's 42/78 coexists with its saved SJ Result's 14/29, seven
Cards and equal-best Jacks; exact downloads are unchanged. See the
[recorded-Trick guide](recorded_trick_progress.md) and
[independent installed evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#r05-recorded-history-and-party-score).
#245 stays completed; remaining R05 wording and other findings stay open. Both
exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #246 closure. #208 stays open, UAT-01
unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. No release-readiness
claim follows.

Issue #247 implements R05's bounded remaining-hand and Skat/discard wording, from
clean `e9e1fc0ec2bb5bf474307804f8d90b62a9d51ecd`. Session distinguishes initial
seating, partial initial entry, pickup/discard knowledge and remaining hands;
unknown, exhausted exact and public-hand evidence retain their source meanings.
The shared final pair has concise recorded/derived attribution with separate
non-Hand original Skat. Editors, #234 eligibility, source/retained data and #238–#246
remain intact. The maintainer approved actual #246 intermediate hands (C10/CJ/DK/D7
after six Tricks; CJ after nine), rather than the conflicting #247 planning table.
See the [wording contract](unplayed_card_summary.md#issue-247-wording-verification)
and [installed evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#r05-remaining-hands-and-evidence-labels).
#246 stays completed. Both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate #247 closure; #208 and
other findings stay open, UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and
B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #248 implements the bounded R04 Card-presentation slice from clean
`340c251b8000c4aa07091b0a3763854f486b29e9`: four fixed printed suits with each Jack
first, opt-in set display copies, uniform native tile width, shared red/dark faces,
and quiet single-Play feedback. Canonical batches, legal subsets, ordered history,
ranked/retained Results and #238–#247 stay intact. Independent Wheels and real
de/en native/enhanced forms preserve exact SJ downloads; see
[compact Card evidence](compact_card_entry.md#issue-248-current-installed-evidence).
#247 stays completed; both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #248 closure.
#208, R06 and other findings remain open, UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused,
B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #249 implements bounded R06 Match single-Card correction from clean
`33929aa4352006bf3ace1910d023677bebef532d`: shared full-deck singular radios,
separate verified preview, concise actual effects, named replacement Apply and
separate unchanged rewind checkbox consent. Existing select clears superseded
preview tokens without renewing expiry; core recovery, wire/source/CAS and Report
semantics remain intact. Independent installed Wheels retain exact passive Match
Reports and unrelated real SJ 14/29/equal-best downloads. See
[current recovery evidence](match_recording_error_recovery.md#issue-249-current-evidence).
#248 stays completed. Both exact merged-commit `check` and
`v1-supported-platform-matrix` gate manual #249 closure; #208, remaining R06 and
other findings remain open. UAT-01 is unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open,
B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #250 adds private staged Session declarer/declaration correction from clean
`6134c3dd72588b56799a6f96dea581b601355a30`: accepted-fact entry, source-Command
prefill, canonical immutable Preview, full/no-op named Apply and fresh partial-
removal consent. Existing replay/Checkpoint/CAS semantics and legacy expert direct
transport remain. Four routes/five definitions intentionally bring the private
inventory to 67/112, with 1,657 paired catalog keys. See
[Session correction](session_undo_and_correction.md#normal-browser-declarerdeclaration-correction-issue-250)
for synthetic HTTP/installed-browser evidence. #249 stays completed; both exact
merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #250 closure. #208/other findings remain open,
UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused, B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed.

Issue #251 repairs only narrow/enlarged single-decision candidate comparisons, from
clean `9ea3ec887f03d668f68dbbacf93309fce7be1ca7`. Position Alternatives and selected
unified Match Reports share private single-copy table markup with local-width/text-
relative labelled reflow. Metrics, order, method routing, historical context and
exact downloads remain unchanged. Independent baseline/repaired Wheels cover both
renderers, de/en, script/no-script, real Immediate/Search/Match execution, accessibility
trees and 320px/200%-text cells; see [current visual evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#responsive-candidate-comparisons-issue-251).
The repaired candidate limitation supersedes earlier observations; unrelated tables
and R11 findings remain separate. Inventory stays 67/112 and 1,657 paired keys.
#250 stays completed; exact merged-commit `check` and `v1-supported-platform-matrix`
gate manual #251 closure. #208 remains open, UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused,
B-09/B-07 open and B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #252 clarifies analysis downloads/details from clean
`a1c277c500ab47168be12c42cd0ac9fbf90e635c`: native visible Request/Result actions
(selected Match Report: Result only), one source-owned shared technical disclosure,
no blanket raw mirror, and named recording/import scopes. Model, transport, exact
bytes and lifetimes remain; #251 stays completed. Independent Wheels and genuine
HTTP forms cover Session SJ, selected Match, imported Search and Historical Results;
see [ownership](unified_local_frontend_guided_analysis_and_results.md#artifact-and-technical-content-ownership-issue-252)
and [evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#analysis-downloads-and-technical-details-issue-252).
Inventory remains 67 POST routes / 112 forms; nine new paired captions bring catalogs
from 1,657 to 1,666 keys. Both exact merged-commit CI jobs remain closure gates.
#208, remaining R11/other findings stay open; UAT-01 unaccepted, UAT-02–12 paused,
B-09/B-07 open, B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Issue #253 adds private single-decision explanations from clean
`9b0e01e4395448c8e5d535b6f772f877907bbcbf`: effective method, distinct sample/Search
units, bound history versus accepted information mode, and actual concrete Skat use.
Shared Position and selected unified Match compose one frozen scalar projection;
engine semantics, defaults, exact bytes, #240/#241/#251/#252 and source lifetimes remain.
Inventory stays 67 POST routes / 112 forms; 62 paired catalog entries bring 1,666 to
1,728. See [mapping](unified_local_frontend_guided_analysis_and_results.md#single-decision-method-and-information-scope-issue-253)
and [browser evidence](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md#analysis-explanations-issue-253).
#252 remains completed. Both exact merged-commit CI jobs gate manual #253 closure;

and B-06 closed. No release-readiness claim follows.

Keep immutable imported Workspace Snapshots separate from derived artifacts.
Public Match/Corpus/Dataset-v2 surfaces, derived persistence, broader Player
Ratings and tactical truth, latency guarantees, database deployment, and
Historical Teacher import are not v1 requirements. The approved local Session
browser integration is implemented by #212; broader solver, auction, learned-model,
and hosted/remote work remains post-v1.

Do not infer automatic newest selection, fuzzy Player merging, cross-revision
Decision lineage, deletion, garbage collection, Human Evidence persistence,
Strategy Teacher persistence, Historical Report import, ground-truth teacher
labels, Dataset-v2 persistence/task builders, automatic Report capture, or
public exposure from Issues #171 through #179. Those areas require separate acceptance
criteria. No production model is
planned.

## Open future topics

The approved pre-`v1.0.0`, post-`v1.0.0`, not-required, and excluded product
areas are recorded in [v1.0 scope](v1_scope.md) and frozen by the
[v1.0 scope and traceability audit](v1_0_scope_and_traceability_audit.md).
Four-player tables remain the only unconditional exclusion.

## New-thread starter instruction

When continuing in a new ChatGPT thread, provide:

1. the repository URL
2. this file
3. the current roadmap
4. the next desired milestone
5. the instruction that code and program output should remain in English while discussion can remain in German
