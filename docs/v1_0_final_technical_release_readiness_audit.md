# v1.0.0 final technical Release-readiness audit

## Audit purpose

This document is the authoritative Issue #207 final technical audit of the
bounded SkatMind v1 technical baseline. It reconciles Issues #201 through #206,
the complete required-before-v1 ledger, current executable contracts, Package
and platform evidence, and the remaining Release-process Gates. It changes
documentation only.

The audit finds no material technical Release blocker and records the technical
decision to close B-06. That closure and approval to begin hands-on maintainer
UAT under Issue #208 become final only after the Issue #207 change is merged and
its two required CI jobs are green. B-09 and B-07 remain open. Package `1.0.0`
is not prepared, Package version remains `0.17.0`, and `v1.0.0` is not Release-
ready.

This audit does not implement or fix product behavior, perform UAT, prepare a
Release candidate, change the Changelog, choose Release metadata, tag, publish,
or deploy anything.

## Authoritative source hierarchy

Conflicts are resolved through this seven-level hierarchy:

1. Official ISkO/SkWO and accepted International Skat Court material govern
   game and competition rules.
2. Approved repository product decisions and normative matrices govern the
   bounded SkatMind product scope.
3. Current executable contracts, constants, Package metadata, persistence, and
   source govern implemented behavior.
4. Authoritative Schemas and byte-identical packaged resources govern stable
   JSON documents.
5. Examples, generated outputs, benchmark corpora, validators, tests, complete
   checks, and CI provide executable evidence.
6. This audit and synchronized current-state documentation govern the current
   readiness conclusion.
7. Historical Changelog, Issue-era, readiness, and Release records remain
   point-in-time evidence and are not rewritten with later identities or counts.

GitHub Releases is authoritative for publication status. No Package-index or
PyPI publication is claimed.

## Published and current baselines

The three relevant states remain distinct:

```text
Published historical Release:
    v0.17.0

Current technical baseline:
    SkatMind Package 0.17.0

Future Release candidate:
    Package 1.0.0 not prepared
```

The published `v0.17.0 — Rules, Search, Coaching, and performance closure`
Release remains historical evidence with these exact point-in-time facts:

| Dimension | Published historical `v0.17.0` value |
| --- | --- |
| Publication commit | `8187fbe684559f9c0c2ba444be1bf33950359ad2` (`8187fbe`) |
| Publication date | 2026-08-25 |
| Package version | `0.17.0` |
| Distribution/import namespace | `skat-ai` / `skat_ai` |
| Console Script | `skat-ai = skat_ai.cli:main` |
| Python metadata | `>=3.13` |
| Public API contract | `1` |
| Root workflows | 7 |
| Console Scripts | 1 |
| Settlement Normative Matrix | version `3` |
| Canonical Settlement cases | 61 |
| Authoritative Schemas | 71 |
| Packaged Schema Resources | 71 |
| Session examples | 6 |
| Generated outputs | 98 |
| Private Corpus prepared downloads | 10 |
| Published pytest result | 7,479 passed in 921.96s |

Those former identities are historical evidence, not active aliases. The
current pre-v1 technical baseline is separately:

| Dimension | Current technical value |
| --- | --- |
| Product | SkatMind |
| Repository | `hnnng-w/skatmind` |
| Package version | `0.17.0` |
| Distribution/import namespace | `skatmind` |
| Console Script | `skatmind = skatmind.cli:main` |
| Python metadata | `>=3.13` |
| Certified v1 runtime | CPython 3.13 |
| License | `AGPL-3.0-only` |
| Direct runtime dependencies | `jsonschema>=4.23.0`, then `referencing>=0.31.0` |
| Public API contract | `1` |

## Issues #201 through #206 closure inventory

| Issue | Exact technical outcome | Gate result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #201 | Adds an independent literal rule oracle for 32 unique Cards, 120 total points, 25 strongest-to-weakest effective-category sequences, 674 strict pairwise comparisons, and 240 declared-value rows: 220 Suit and 20 Grand. It changes no product code. | R-01 and R-06 `satisfied`; B-01 closed. |
| #202 | Enforces the four internal stages `loaded_request`, `validated_consumed_input`, `retained_stage_linkage`, and `final_serialization` for all seven Root workflows. It covers exact Request/options/external sources, pre-analysis Information Use Context, retained-stage authorization, and final Result/artifact reconciliation without widening public Provenance. | P-10 and P-13 `satisfied`; B-02 closed. |
| #203 | Covers all nine canonical concrete Multi-Step phases, including same-World current-Trick completion, local-card preservation, local-Decision-only step counting, unchanged Search isolation, Policy Comparison parity, and one intentional existing-scenario behavior update without a Schema or scenario-count change. | P-19 `satisfied`; B-03 closed. |
| #204 | Applies `AGPL-3.0-only`, exact root legal files, PEP 639 metadata, Wheel/sdist/installed legal-file validation, and dependency/asset license review. `LICENSE` SHA-256 is `d8a6cc31abc16b6748c7a21f21611f5a1ec33f67d22ca23d7da1c19b95496bee`; `COPYRIGHT` is exactly `Copyright (C) 2026 Henning Wiese` plus LF. | B-04 closed. |
| #205 | Completes the hard-cut SkatMind product, repository, distribution, namespace, CLI, resource, Schema, active-identifier, and persistence migration. There is no active former Package/import/CLI alias. Strict released version-1 persisted input remains readable; canonical writes use SkatMind identities; verified immutable legacy Corpus IDs remain opaque. The reviewed occurrence inventory is exact. | P-09 `satisfied`; B-08 closed. |
| #206 | Declares the two exact direct dependency floors; validates resolved Source, Editable, Wheel, and sdist plus exact-minimum Wheel and sdist; exercises all seven workflows, APIs, CLI forms, Session, Capture, Corpus, Provenance, resources, errors, Exit Codes, semantic parity, `pip check`, and repository non-mutation on Windows and Ubuntu. | P-34 `satisfied`; B-05 closed. |

The exact merged Issue #206 commit is
`af9de1a63ed23b84cc758d0d0504a3c72073dbb0`. GitHub Actions run
[`33182864852`](https://github.com/hnnng-w/skatmind/actions/runs/33182864852)
passed both `check` in 1h 1m 36s and `v1-supported-platform-matrix` in
1h 8m 25s on `ubuntu-latest` with Python 3.13.

## Complete 53-row ledger reconciliation

The required-before-v1 ledger contains exactly 17 ISkO rows, two SkWO rows, and
34 Product rows. No row is omitted or duplicated.

| Audit status | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `satisfied` | 19 |
| `satisfied_with_approved_bounded_scope` | 34 |
| `evidence_required` | 0 |
| `implementation_required` | 0 |
| `product_decision_required` | 0 |
| **Total** | **53** |

Every row retains a direct evidence anchor, has no missing v1 work, and has no
implementation blocker. Accepted bounded rows are not generalized beyond their
stated limits.

## Rules, Claims, Settlement, and Historical audit

The bounded Rules contract covers Card points/order, legal play, Tricks, final
declarations, Matadors where inferable, Suit/Grand values, all four Null values,
Overbid within the approved paths, normal Results, supported shortened endings,
one continuation before completion or shortening, and strict Historical Games.

Settlement Normative Matrix version `3` retains exactly 61 canonical case IDs:
48 `supported_as_is`, 13 `not_supported_v1`, and zero requiring implementation
or decision. The only v1 Claim is the Historical party-wide all-remaining-Tricks
Claim with one through five unresolved Tricks and valid exact AND/OR proof.
Invalid or unavailable proof rejects the terminal record without fallback.

The audit retains no general Claim interface, complete official Claim or
Settlement coverage, arbitrary event-stream adjudication, generalized conduct
or correction handling, or four-player support claim.

## Search, simulation, inference, and Recommendation audit

The current bounded contract includes deterministic Immediate Analysis, late
Perfect-Information Minimax, compatible-world PIMC, exact and sampled Worlds,
equal duplicate sampled-draw weight, structural budgets, explicit complete,
partial, timeout, and unavailable Results, selected-world Information-set
Search, all nine Multi-Step phases, Policy Comparison, Match/Historical/Dataset
integration, and deterministic functional/structural benchmarks.

Information-set execution controls Player `me` for at most three unresolved
Tricks. Other Players retain fixed deterministic Policies; equal controlled
Observations must choose equal actions. Exact Worlds, hidden ownership,
Observations, controlled Policies, branch state, and caches remain private.
Recommendation remains legal, perspective-aware, objective-aware, deterministic
under fixed inputs, and explicit when no recommendation is available.

The candidate claims no equilibrium, CFR, calibrated probability, complete-
contract solver, joint Defender optimization, global optimality, Information-
set-aware `auto`, complete Strategy-Fusion correction, or latency SLA.

## Information-Provenance audit

Internal information-Provenance contract version `1` and public Provenance
version `1` remain unchanged. The mandatory lifecycle is:

```text
loaded_request
validated_consumed_input
retained_stage_linkage
final_serialization
```

All seven Root workflows retain exact consumed Request, effective option, and
optional external-source attachments; enforce independent Information Use
Context before analysis; authorize retained-stage dependencies and temporal use;
and reconcile the final Result and artifacts actually returned. Mutation,
uncovered leaves, orphaned entries, cross-workflow references, widened
visibility, temporal inversion, and artifact mismatches are rejected.

Public conversion reruns no workflow. It remains default-omitted and exposes
only one exact redacted Root Result plus artifacts actually returned, with
coverage recomputed after redaction. Consumed-input, Decision, intermediate,
hidden-world, source-binding, and lifecycle-checkpoint evidence remains private.
Provenance and Confidence remain separate contracts.

## Public API, CLI, and error audit

The stable namespaces and exact ordered export counts are:

| Namespace | Exports |
| --- | ---: |
| `skatmind` | 3 |
| `skatmind.api` | 1 |
| `skatmind.api.v1` | 40 |
| `skatmind.api.v1.session` | 59 |
| `skatmind.api.v1.session.files` | 12 |
| `skatmind.errors` | 13 |

Runtime inspection and existing exact-order tests confirm the source-controlled
ordered `__all__` tuples. The Package Root is exactly `api`, `errors`, and
`__version__`; `skatmind.api` exports exactly `v1`. The 40 API-v1 exports retain
the contract/version values, immutable Request/options/Result/artifact values,
version information, `parse_request`, `execute`, `execute_document`,
`serialize_result`, public Provenance values, three Exit Codes, ten error/warning
classes, and the appended `session` namespace in their existing order.

The Session namespace retains 59 exports: version/namespace/policy constants,
the 12-operation tuple, Provenance values, version/options/Result values, all
Session contracts and typed Commands, parse/create/apply/rewind/correct/export/
checkpoint/persistence/serialization operations, Decision Observation and
Checkpoint Review contracts/operations, and the appended `files` namespace in
their existing order. The file namespace retains its three constants, four
public values, version query, Save, Load, and serializer in their existing
12-name order. `skatmind.errors` retains three Exit Code constants followed by
the stable error hierarchy and `SkatMindDeprecationWarning`.

The seven ordered `WorkflowV1` values remain:

```text
position_analysis
historical_game
training_dataset
training_dataset_preparation
opponent_statistics
fixed_three_player_historical_list
fixed_three_player_historical_list_comparison
```

The normal Result states remain `complete`, `partial`, `timeout`, `unavailable`,
`final`, `lot_required`, and `not_assessable`. Exit Codes remain `0`, `1`, and
`2`. Supported CLI forms remain installed `skatmind`, module
`python -m skatmind`, and repository Legacy `python main.py` through one Console
Script. The 12 Session subcommands remain `new`, `show`, `apply`, `undo`,
`correct`, `checkpoint`, `export-position`, `export-historical`, `analyze`,
`review`, `finalize`, and `assistant`. Private `capture` and `corpus` are CLI
families, not Root workflows or public Python namespaces. No active former
Package, import, module, or command alias exists.

## Schema, example, and generated-output audit

The current exact set is 71 authoritative `schemas/*.schema.json` files and 71
byte-identical packaged resources. Filename sets and bytes match; every `$id` is
unique and follows `https://example.local/skatmind/<filename>`; local `$ref`
resolution is complete and does not use the network.

All Root examples and exactly six Session examples pass their Schema and semantic
validators. The six Session files are `session_create_live.json`,
`session_create_retrospective.json`, `session_command_record_play.json`,
`session_correction_record_play.json`, `session_live_persistence.json`, and
`session_retrospective_persistence.json`.

The ordered generated-output registry remains exactly 98 scenarios: 1-70
pre-public-Provenance Root coverage, 71-77 one public-Provenance scenario per
Root workflow, 78-85 Session, 86-88 Historical Claim, 89-92 Information-set
Search, 93-94 Information-set Multi-Step/Policy Comparison, 95-96
Information-set Replay Coaching, and 97-98 Tactical Motif Review. Scenario IDs
and order remain stable. Historical Release counts remain historical.

## Session, Match, Corpus, and Dataset audit

The public Session API, Session version-1 persistence, automatic exact
Checkpoints, observations, request exports, analysis/review operations, public
file Save/Load, and all-three-form Session CLI remain the bounded public local
capture surface.

Match Capture remains a private local fixed-three-player workflow over one
explicit version-1 Workspace file. It provides rapid entry, evidence-aware
Games, annotations, information-safe preparation, explicit bounded analysis,
ephemeral Reports, authenticated downloads, and no Public Match API, Schema, or
eighth Root workflow.

Learning Corpus remains a private local workflow over one explicit version-1
root/Catalog/object store. Current-Snapshot Player Catalog, Human Evidence,
Strategy Teacher Evidence, Learning Dataset version `2`, partition preparation,
summaries, Tactical Evidence, Tactical Coaching, and all ten downloads remain
derived process-local values. They do not create a Public Corpus/Dataset-v2 API
or Schema and are not persisted as derived artifacts. Database, remote, and
collaborative deployment remain absent.

## Persistence and migration audit

Session documents, Match Workspace documents, Learning Corpus Catalogs and
immutable objects, and Match Analysis Report-source documents remain strict
version `1`. Canonical writers emit the active SkatMind kinds and SHA-256
domains. Released pre-rename documents are accepted only through an exact full
legacy profile; mixed kinds, fingerprint domains, IDs, or nested identity
relationships are rejected. Load does not mutate input. An explicit successful
rewrite emits canonical identities.

Compare-and-swap and same-directory atomic replacement remain required for
mutable local files. Immutable object publication remains no-clobber. Verified
legacy content-addressed Corpus IDs remain opaque and are not rekeyed, copied, or
deleted. There is no automatic destructive migration.

## Coaching, Tactical, and Player-analysis audit

The bounded contract includes Replay Coaching, Information-set Replay Coaching,
Historical Tactical Motif Review, Current-Snapshot Tactical Motif Evidence,
exact descriptive cross-game summaries, Tactical Cross-game Coaching, fixed
Guidance, time-safe Statistics, and rule-based Profiles.

Actual Cards are observed behavior rather than ground truth. Teacher evidence is
method-bound. Tactical Motifs are structural observations. Cross-game Focus
Areas are bounded review aids. The product makes no Player Rating, perfect-play,
trait, strength, weakness, intent, signaling, communication, causal, or
statistical-significance claim.

## Package, license, dependencies, and distribution audit

The Package remains `0.17.0`, Python metadata remains `>=3.13`, the build backend
remains `setuptools.build_meta` with `setuptools>=77.0.3`, and runtime dependencies
remain exactly `jsonschema>=4.23.0` then `referencing>=0.31.0`. There is one
`dev` extra, one Console Script, `py.typed`, 71 packaged Schemas, and packaged
Capture/Corpus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Source, Editable, Wheel, and sdist resolved lanes and exact-minimum Wheel/sdist
lanes pass. The exact floor pair is `jsonschema==4.23.0` and
`referencing==0.31.0`; normal resolved evidence records the versions selected by
the resolver without imposing a latest-version claim. Every installed lane runs
`pip check`. Wheel, sdist, installed metadata, legal files, resources, APIs, CLI
forms, and semantic outputs are reconciled. No Package-index/PyPI publication is
claimed.

## Windows and Ubuntu supported-platform audit

The exact certified v1 boundary is:

```text
Windows:

Issue #206 local evidence used CPython 3.13.7, passed all six executable matrix
cells, passed `7,658` pytest tests in 1999.08s, ended with `All checks passed.`,
and passed `git diff --check`. The exact merged Ubuntu evidence is run
`33182864852` on commit
`af9de1a63ed23b84cc758d0d0504a3c72073dbb0`, with both required jobs green.

Issue #207 focused regression evidence on Windows/CPython 3.13.7 passed 510
tests in 784.94s. It covers official Rules, Claim/Settlement, internal/public
Provenance, canonical Multi-Step phases, license, rename/migration, platform
matrix contracts, Public API, installed CLI, Session, Match persistence, Corpus
persistence/downloads, and distribution. One unchanged-tree complete local check
runs after this documentation is final. Its exact result, full pytest count and
timing, clean diff/worktree evidence, merged commit, and both post-merge job
results are retained in the Issue completion record. The check is an Issue-
closure control, not a new product or platform contract.

No macOS, Python 3.14, named-browser, hardware-minimum, cross-machine latency,
Docker, production-SLA, or hosted-deployment certification is claimed.

## Privacy, security, and product-claim audit

Live and Retrospective information remain separated by exact visibility and
temporal contexts. Search Worlds, hidden ownership, controlled Policies, caches,
and branches remain private. Public Provenance is redacted and recomputed.
Match/Corpus dashboards and downloads remain minimized and path-free.

At the Issue #207 audit baseline, Capture and Corpus bind only to `127.0.0.1`,
accept only loopback/localhost Host
values for the active port, require an unguessable bootstrap token and
constant-time cookie comparison, use `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` cookies, enforce
same-origin mutation requests, send no-store/nosniff/no-referrer/frame-denial,
CSP, and Permissions-Policy headers, use packaged local assets, and declare no
external runtime request. Focused browser tests reject bad Host, token, cookie,
Origin, method, size, route, and path traversal cases and verify token/path
non-disclosure.

This local boundary is not an encryption, key-management, account, remote-
hosting, cloud, collaboration, backup, or production-security claim.

## Accepted bounded v1 limitations

The following are accepted limitations, not technical blockers:

* final declaration rather than full auction reconstruction;
* one Historical-only party-wide Claim bounded to five unresolved Tricks;
* six supported terminal shortenings and at most one continuation;
* supplied impossible-Null replacement rather than optimization;
* bounded late-game exact/PIMC and three-Trick Information-set Search;
* no equilibrium, calibrated probability, complete-contract, global-optimality,
  or latency claim;
* structural inference, heuristic Confidence, and rule-based Profiles;
* structural Tactical evidence without truth, trait, communication, causality,
  significance, or Rating claims;
* private local Match and Corpus surfaces and process-local derived artifacts;
* strict local version-1 persistence without remote access, encryption, merge,
  or backup; and
* no Package-index/PyPI publication requirement.

## Post-v1 work

Post-v1 directions include full auction modeling, broader/complete-contract
solvers, wider imperfect-information policy solving, equilibrium/CFR research,
calibrated probability, learned Profiles, model training, online-platform
adapters, browser extensions, and remote/collaborative deployment after separate
security and operations decisions. These directions are not promoted into the
required v1 ledger.

## Not-required work

Formal series aggregation, tournament management, official federation reports,
Public Match/Corpus/Dataset-v2 APIs or Schemas, Match/Corpus Root workflows,
derived-artifact persistence, automatic Report capture, Historical Report
import, database deployment, broader Ratings, Provenance/Confidence unification,
Session GUI/browser UI, distributed locking, encryption/key management,
automatic backup, dedicated production Budget profiles, latency/SLO guarantees,
macOS or named-browser certification, Package-index metadata/publication,
Information-set-aware `auto`, and general natural-language Claim adjudication are
not required for v1.

## Unconditional exclusion

Four-player table support is the only unconditional exclusion.

## Technical blocker sweep

The audit searched current executable evidence and code-adjacent documentation
for contradictions in required-row status, metadata, public exports, workflow
counts, Schema count/identity, persistence, dependencies, installation forms,
platforms, license, output registry, identity, information boundaries, security,
and accepted limitations.

| Finding | Classification | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current-state summaries still described B-05 and Issue #206 as conditional on merged Ubuntu CI. | `documentation_correction` | Synchronized by Issue #207; the required run and both jobs passed. |
| `public_python_api_v1.md` said the active packaged registry had 63 resources. | `documentation_correction` | Corrected to the current exact count of 71; historical 63-count Release statements remain unchanged. |
| `bounded_search_contracts.md` said the stronger-Search v1 gate remained open. | `documentation_correction` | Corrected to the Issue #200 approved bounded v1 contract; broader Search remains post-v1. |
| The active architecture summary omitted the supported Historical party-wide Claim from two workflow lists. | `documentation_correction` | Added the bounded Historical-only Claim without broadening its contract. |
| The new published-baseline table introduced four reviewed former-name occurrences. | `documentation_correction` | Classified all four as `historical_evidence` in the exact rename inventory. |
| Historical Issue-era files retain former identities, old counts, and then-current next actions. | `historical_only` | Preserved as point-in-time evidence under the rename inventory and source hierarchy. |
| General Claim/Settlement behavior beyond the approved exact boundary is absent. | `accepted_bounded_limitation` | Preserved as the frozen bounded v1 contract. |
| Complete solvers, calibrated models, and remote/collaborative deployment are absent. | `post_v1` | Preserved as later directions requiring separate decisions and acceptance criteria. |
| Public private-workflow APIs, derived persistence, broader Ratings, and latency certification are absent. | `not_required` | Preserved as work not required for the frozen v1 product. |

No finding is a `material_blocker`. No remediation Issue is required before UAT.

## Post-merge closure control

Issue #207 remains open until the maintainer verifies both required GitHub
Actions jobs on the exact merged Issue #207 commit:

```text
check:
    succeeded

v1-supported-platform-matrix:
    succeeded
```

Only after that evidence is green may B-06 and Issue #207 be finally closed and
Issue #208 begin. If either job fails, B-06 remains open, UAT does not begin, and
the failure must be classified before proceeding. OpenCode cannot verify that
future merged-commit evidence.

Issue #208 performs hands-on maintainer v1.0.0 user acceptance testing. It must
exercise representative supported workflows and local interfaces, classify
findings, create focused remediation Issues for accepted material findings, and
close B-09 only when those findings are resolved or explicitly accepted as
non-blocking. Issue #207 performs no UAT.

B-07 Release preparation remains open. It may begin only after B-06 and B-09 are
closed and any affected technical evidence is refreshed. Issue #207 does not set
Package `1.0.0`, add a Changelog section, prepare Release metadata, tag, or
publish. The exact next action after the post-merge control is Issue #208,
**Perform maintainer v1.0.0 user acceptance testing**.

## Post-audit UAT note

This note records later Issue #208 through #217 state without rewriting the Issue
#207 technical conclusion above. Maintainer UAT began after the #207 merge and
required CI. UAT-01 technically executed but failed user acceptance with one
accepted blocker and two accepted major findings:

```text
UAT-FINDING-001:
    No acceptable primary Product user interface exists.

UAT-FINDING-002:
    Root CLI onboarding is an unstructured expert interface.

UAT-FINDING-003:
    Session, Match Workspace, and Learning Corpus are not understandable
    user concepts.
```

Issue #209 freezes the approved
[unified local frontend contract](unified_local_frontend_contract.md) and the
exact #210 through #213 implementation sequence. Issue #210 implements the
[application shell](unified_local_frontend_application_shell.md) and partially
remediates UAT-FINDING-001. Issue #211 implements
[guided analysis and Results](unified_local_frontend_guided_analysis_and_results.md)
and further partially remediates the finding without closing it. Issue #212
implements [managed stateful workflows](unified_local_frontend_stateful_workflows.md),
further remediates UAT-FINDING-001, and implements the Product work owned by
UAT-FINDING-003 without closing either finding before repeated UAT. It does not
repeat UAT-01 or resume UAT-02 through UAT-12. Issue #213 implements canonical
`run`, concise Product help, grouped advanced automation help, and direct Root
compatibility without closing a finding before repeated UAT.

Repeated UAT-01 after Issue #213 reached authenticated GET navigation but every
tested Review, Session, Match, and Corpus mutation returned HTTP 403. The
accepted UAT-FINDING-004 root cause was the combination of
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and strict concrete-Origin validation: Fetch
serialized a non-CORS browser request whose method was neither GET nor HEAD with
`Origin: null` under that policy. Issue #214 changed the unified app, standalone
Capture, and standalone Corpus to `Referrer-Policy: origin`. This preserves a
concrete same-origin request Origin while any Referer contains only scheme, host,
and port, not path or query. Null, missing, duplicate, malformed, forged,
credential-bearing, path/query/fragment-bearing, wrong-port, and Host-mismatched
Origins remain rejected. Referer and `Sec-Fetch-Site` remain non-authoritative,
and the unified app renders a deterministic value-free HTML authorization 403.

Maintainer Microsoft Edge verification subsequently resolved Issue #214 and
UAT-FINDING-004. Repeated UAT-01 nevertheless failed. Issue #215 freezes the
authoritative
[bilingual profile-driven frontend UX contract](bilingual_profile_driven_frontend_ux_contract.md)
without rewriting the Issue #207 technical conclusion.

Issue #216 implements the private local frontend profile, strict German/English
catalogs, locale resolution, global language selection, bilingual shared shell,
current flat Home, About, authorization, generic common errors, and explicit
English workflow-body boundary. It further partially remediates
UAT-FINDING-001, implements the foundation for UAT-FINDING-007, and implements
foundation/common coverage for UAT-FINDING-008. Those three findings remain
open; UAT-FINDING-003, UAT-FINDING-005, and UAT-FINDING-006 remain open;
UAT-FINDING-002 and UAT-FINDING-004 remain resolved. Issue #216 does not repeat
UAT-01, resume UAT-02 through UAT-12, reopen B-06, or change the Issue #207
technical conclusion.

Post-merge Ubuntu CI at `087f497` then reopened Issue #216. The `check` job on
CPython 3.13.15 exposed a parser-level compatibility defect: rejected HTTP/0.9
left a plain empty dictionary in `BaseHTTPRequestHandler.headers`, while the
localized common-error path expected `get_all()`. The correction treats absent,
`None`, mapping, and partial header containers as no browser-language evidence,
retains saved-profile precedence and English fallback, and still returns
hardened HTTP `400` and `505` responses without a request-thread traceback. The
separate `source-resolved` matrix failure was an installed-smoke filename
mismatch between older unsuffixed expectations and the emitted `compatibility`
and canonical `run` files, not the localization defect. The smoke now validates
both files, and bounded sanitized matrix diagnostics retain the failed cell,
child exception category, command, stdout, and stderr. Both required post-merge
Ubuntu jobs passed, completing Issue #216.

Issue #217 implements the private
[grouped bilingual Home information architecture](bilingual_home_information_architecture.md),
clarifies the Decision, individual-Game, complete-Match, and multiple-Matches
units, changes Analyze from Live-only wording to current or retrospective,
defines Review as one completed individual Game, explains Session versus Match,
describes Learning prerequisites and explicit steps, adds safe related-area GET
links, and adds useful bilingual stateful empty states. Existing future-owned
workflow forms remain explicitly marked English on German pages. No Product
operation, persistence, machine Route, Public API, Schema, example, generated
output, Package version, dependency, or technical-ledger classification changes.

Issue #218 implements private version-1 frontend validation preservation with a
canonical form registry, rejected submitted state separate from accepted
workflow and Product state, bounded allowlisted visible-value retention,
localized accessible error summaries and field messages, exact active-context
binding, contextual `400`/`409` responses, and successful `303` PRG. Raw Product,
parser, upload, path, token, handle, and file values are not rendered. Standalone
Session, Capture, and Corpus servers, Product behavior, persistence, Public API,
CLI, Schemas, examples, generated outputs, dependencies, and Package version are
unchanged. UAT-FINDING-006 has its assigned implementation complete but remains
open pending repeated maintainer UAT-01.

Issue #219 implements private version-1
[profile-driven stateful creation](profile_driven_stateful_creation.md): known
Players and opaque handles, generated Player/Session/Match/Corpus identities,
saved creation defaults and managed labels, bilingual name-first Session/Match/
Learning creation, friendly Match metadata, secondary imports, and strict
Product-first/profile-second failure handling. It changes no Product persistence,
Public API, CLI, Schema, example, generated output, dependency, Package version,
or 53-row technical classification.

The post-audit Release-process state is:

The 53-row ledger remains exactly 19 `satisfied`, 34
`satisfied_with_approved_bounded_scope`, and zero in each unresolved
classification. Frontend and UAT work remains under B-09 outside that ledger and
does not reopen B-06. Issue #219 is implemented without changing the historical
Issue-#207 technical conclusion. After Issue #220 merge and green exact-commit
`check` and `v1-supported-platform-matrix`, repeat UAT-01 under Issue #208.
