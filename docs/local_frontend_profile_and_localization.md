# Local frontend profile and localization

## Status

Issue #216 implements the private local frontend profile and localization
foundation approved by the
[bilingual profile-driven frontend UX contract](bilingual_profile_driven_frontend_ux_contract.md).
Issue #219 subsequently activates the reserved Player, perspective, platform,
interface-preference, and managed-label fields without changing profile version
`1`; that creation layer is documented in [Profile-driven stateful
creation](profile_driven_stateful_creation.md). This is private unified-browser behavior. It is not a Public API export, an
eighth Root workflow, a public Schema, or a Product persistence format.

Issue #225 subsequently moves operational controls to **Settings**, keeps About
informational, and revises normal Player/own-seat/default behavior. Legacy profile
fields and bytes remain compatible. See [Settings and Player seat
setup](settings_and_player_seat_setup.md) for the lossless adapter and confirmation policy.

The implemented contract versions are exactly:

```text
BILINGUAL_FRONTEND_CONTRACT_VERSION = 1
FRONTEND_TRANSLATION_CATALOG_VERSION = 1
LOCAL_FRONTEND_PROFILE_VERSION = 1
```

Issues #216 through #220 implement the complete frozen policy vocabulary in order:

```text
technical_contracts_and_machine_values_remain_english
unified_frontend_visible_content_supports_german_and_english
one_private_local_frontend_profile_per_managed_data_root
saved_language_overrides_browser_language
browser_language_bootstraps_only_without_saved_preference
user_facing_names_replace_required_manual_internal_ids
normal_workflows_are_task_first_and_profile_driven
advanced_settings_are_secondary_explicit_and_explained
validation_preserves_safe_values_and_workflow_context
home_separates_record_analyze_learn_and_product_information
language_and_profile_never_change_product_semantics
no_external_translation_profile_sync_or_cloud_service
```

The task-first active-workflow and complete Advanced/Technical-detail policies
are implemented by Issue #220. The grouped Home policy is implemented
by Issue #217 and documented in
[Bilingual Home information architecture](bilingual_home_information_architecture.md).

## Language boundary

Repository code, comments, Docstrings, tests, documentation, CLI output, Public
API values, JSON, Schemas, Routes, machine identifiers, Enum values, error codes,
persistence fields, hashes, fingerprints, and generated outputs remain English
and locale-neutral. German exists only as escaped visible unified-browser
presentation.

The supported locales are exactly:

```text
SUPPORTED_FRONTEND_LOCALES = ("de", "en")
FRONTEND_REFERENCE_LOCALE = "en"
FRONTEND_FALLBACK_LOCALE = "en"
```

Standalone `skatmind capture` and `skatmind corpus`, all CLI families, and the
Public Python API remain English and unchanged.

## Catalogs

The repository-owned Package Resources are:

```text
src/skatmind/app_web/locales/en.json
src/skatmind/app_web/locales/de.json
```

They are loaded through `importlib.resources`. Each catalog is one finite flat
JSON object with lexicographically ordered locale-neutral keys and non-empty text
values. Loading rejects a UTF-8 BOM, invalid UTF-8, duplicate object keys,
non-finite values, a non-object root, unsorted keys, non-text values, key drift,
and interpolation-placeholder drift. English is the reference catalog. Missing
German keys fail strictly; runtime lookup does not fall back from German to
English.

Translation lookup returns plain text. The HTML renderer escapes the translated
text and all interpolation results. The implementation uses no network,
translation service, runtime download, CDN, machine translation, generated
bundle, or Node toolchain.

## Locale resolution

Each request resolves locale in this order:

```text
1. saved profile language
2. one usable Accept-Language header when no language is saved
3. English fallback
```

`de` and `de-*` select German; `en` and `en-*` select English. Positive quality
values are ordered by descending quality and then original range order. Zero
quality, malformed, wildcard-only, unsupported, oversized, and unusable input is
ignored safely. Duplicate `Accept-Language` headers do not become trusted input.
The raw header is never retained.

Browser-derived language is process-request input only and is never persisted
automatically. A saved language always overrides later browser-language changes.
An invalid profile is trusted for no preference and forces English fallback.

## Profile document

One profile may exist as the regular non-link direct child:

```text
<managed-data-root>/frontend-profile.json
```

It is separate from the three managed categories `sessions`, `matches`, and
`corpora`, and managed discovery ignores it. Startup and browser-language
detection do not create it. Explicit language selection, local settings,
successful stateful creation labels, or explicit reset may create it.

The exact Issue #216 document shape is:

```json
{
  "local_frontend_profile_version": 1,
  "document_kind": "skatmind_frontend_profile",
  "revision": 0,
  "language": "de",
  "interface_preferences": {
    "advanced_settings_expanded": false
  },
  "own_player_id": null,
  "known_players": [],
  "preferred_perspective_player_id": null,
  "preferred_game_platform": null,
  "workflow_preferences": {
    "position_analysis": null,
    "historical_review": null
  },
  "managed_item_display_labels": [],
  "content_fingerprint": "<lowercase-sha256>"
}
```

`language` may be `de`, `en`, or null. In the historical Issue-#216 slice, every
then-future-owned Player, perspective, platform, workflow-default, display-label,
and Advanced-settings value remained at its canonical null, empty, or false
value, and Issue #216 exposed no Player management UI. Issue #219 now permits
canonical non-empty known-Player, perspective, platform, interface-preference,
and managed-label values while preserving this exact version-1 shape and the
canonical empty-profile bytes. Workflow-analysis preferences remain null.

Unknown, missing, reordered, or wrongly typed fields are invalid. Boolean
revisions are rejected. The maximum file size is `1,048,576` bytes.

## Fingerprint and bytes

The exact fingerprint domain is:

```text
skatmind\0frontend_profile_v1\0
```

SHA-256 covers the domain and canonical profile payload without
`content_fingerprint`. Final file bytes are deterministic finite JSON using
UTF-8 without BOM, two-space indentation, canonical field order, LF line
endings, and exactly one trailing LF. Loading verifies the fingerprint and exact
canonical byte round trip.

## Persistence

Load statuses are exactly:

```text
absent
available
invalid
```

Write statuses are exactly:

```text
saved
unchanged
conflict
```

Saving uses an expected valid fingerprint, an expected invalid raw-file digest,
or an absent-file expectation. It observes the target before writing and again
immediately before replacement, writes a complete same-directory temporary file,
flushes and syncs it, uses atomic `os.replace`, attempts directory durability,
and cleans up temporary files. It does not retry, merge, silently overwrite, or
repair.

For an oversized, unreadable, or nonregular direct entry that cannot safely
produce bounded raw bytes, the private invalid-digest slot retains a
domain-separated metadata observation instead. This permits a stable second
comparison without following a link or reading an unbounded file. Explicit
reset may replace a link or regular file and may remove an empty directory at
the reserved profile path; a nonempty directory is retained and produces a safe
filesystem failure.

The optimistic boundary is intentionally limited to the required second
pre-replacement observation. It is not a cross-process transaction or an
external lock; the focused contract explicitly adds no coordination outside the
profile file boundary.

Initial explicit profile creation uses revision zero. A changed valid profile
increments revision once. An unchanged operation writes nothing. The app context
uses a separate profile-operation lock and a process-local profile generation so
profile persistence does not hold or mutate Product workflow contexts.

## Invalid profile and reset

An invalid profile remains byte-for-byte unchanged and does not prevent startup.
It contributes no language preference, selects English fallback, and produces
one safe common warning. Browser output includes no parser detail, raw bytes,
profile path, fingerprint, raw digest, stack trace, or failed security value.

Profile-driven creation and all local-setting mutations except reset are blocked
until explicit reset. The reset action compares the
retained valid fingerprint or invalid raw-file digest and atomically publishes
the canonical empty profile. It changes no Session, Match, Learning Corpus,
Result, Report, source, prepared artifact, discovery, or active selection.

## Browser state

The private app context retains the profile path, load state, valid document,
expected fingerprint, invalid raw digest where available, process-local
generation, and safe warning state. Browser-safe rendering receives only:

```text
locale
resolution source
profile status
valid revision when available
profile generation
safe warning flag
```

It receives no path, fingerprint, digest, raw header, token, cookie, port, or
environment value. Trusted server-side settings and creation rendering may
receive a valid profile's names, defaults, opaque handles, and display labels;
the small common-shell projection above remains unchanged. Internal Player IDs
are not rendered as normal visible values. Issue #225 displays external account
metadata only in the selected account editor or explicit replacement preview. Profile loading
occurs once during app context creation; there is no watcher, polling loop,
background worker, or page-load disk read.

## Browser actions

The authenticated profile routes are:

```text
POST /actions/profile/language
POST /actions/profile/reset
POST /actions/profile/players/add
POST /actions/profile/players/update
POST /actions/profile/players/remove
POST /actions/profile/players/edit
POST /actions/profile/players/remove-preview
POST /actions/profile/players/accounts-preview
POST /actions/profile/players/accounts-replace
POST /actions/profile/players/cancel
POST /actions/profile/preferences
POST /actions/profile/recommended-defaults/reset
POST /actions/profile/managed-label
```

Language uses `language`, `profile_generation`, and `return_to`; the rendered
native form also supplies an optional private `_frontend_language_context` binding.
The optional script adds `_frontend_language_values`. Existing bare language POSTs
remain supported. Reset requires
explicit confirmation. Player and preference operations use the current profile
generation and opaque Player handles. Managed labels additionally bind one exact
managed family, handle, and discovery generation. All routes require the app
cookie, exact Host, exact Origin, canonical form encoding, current generation,
and their registered safe return behavior.

Allowed return paths cover the eight shell pages (including `/settings`) plus safe current Session,
Match, Match-position, Match-report, and Learning pages. Validation rejects
external and protocol-relative URLs, query strings, fragments, assets,
downloads, state/API routes, POST actions, bootstrap-token URLs, invalid dynamic
identities, and unknown paths. Referer is neither authorization input nor return
routing input.

Saved and unchanged actions return `303`. Malformed forms return `400`. Stale
generation, invalid-profile mutation, and persistence conflict return `409`.
Stale in-process forms instruct a page reload; an external profile-file conflict
requires restarting SkatMind because page loads do not reread the profile.

To preserve an already retained managed-category discovery through the `303`
language redirect, the process-local app context may retain one pending safe
return Route. Only the matching authenticated HTML GET consumes it. This marker
contains no query, form value, profile digest, Product value, or browser secret.

## Visible coverage

Issue #216 provides German and English presentation for:

* the shared shell, skip link, Product accessibility label, navigation, footer,
  global language selector, and exact HTML `lang`;
* the grouped Home, scope guide, compact task cards, Product concepts, related
  links, and useful stateful empty states through Issue #217;
* About, managed-storage explanation, local/private and no-cloud statements,
  language source, profile status, future-work notice, and reset;
* authorization and generic common HTTP error wrappers;
* render-time German and English validation summaries, field messages, retained-
  Result guidance, stale-form reload guidance, and profile-conflict restart
  guidance through Issues #218 and #219;
* local settings, known-Player/default management, profile-driven Session/Match/
  Learning creation, and managed display-label editing through Issue #219;
* common shell status and action vocabulary.

Every unified page contains the textual `Deutsch` and `English` selector. It is
a native authenticated POST form and works without JavaScript. Issue #223 replaces
the dropdown/Apply pair with two compact native submit buttons. Each activation
submits exactly one absolute target (`de` or `en`). Mutually exclusive
`aria-pressed` values, an underline, contrasting surfaces, and visible keyboard
focus identify the effective rendered locale. Neither button is disabled merely
because it is active: a browser-resolved locale can still be saved explicitly.
The selector uses scoped fixed colors. Issue #224 also removes standalone
Capture/Corpus stylesheet links from unified HTML, eliminating those root and
global-button overrides rather than relying on the selector's cascade protection.

Analyze, Review, Results, and active Session, Match, and Learning workflow bodies
are bilingual through Issue #220. Session, Match, and Learning landings and creation
forms remain bilingual through Issue #219. The obsolete transitional-English
marker is removed. Exact user content and machine values remain untranslated;
raw technical values are disclosed explicitly. The implementation is documented in
[Task-first bilingual stateful workflows](task_first_bilingual_stateful_workflows.md).

## State and security

Language switching changes only profile/locale state. It does not execute or
rerun Product work and retains server-owned Analyze/Review drafts and Results,
Review step, active Session, active Match, active Learning Corpus, Match Reports,
Learning sources/prepared artifacts, discovery state, and the current safe
route. Issue #218 additionally preserves allowlisted submitted browser values
and validation feedback across language changes without rerunning Product work.

### Semantic origin and exact presentation binding

Issue #223 fixes a reproduced return-path defect: rejected creation POSTs rendered
valid creation forms while the shell read the mutation request URL and fell back
to Home. Page renderers now supply their semantic HTML origin explicitly:
`/sessions`, `/matches/new`, `/learning`, `/sessions/current`, the selected
`/matches/position/N` or exact `/matches/reports/ID`, `/learning/current`, `/analyze`,
`/review`, `/settings`, and `/about`. Registered form origins determine contextual rejection
rendering. Navigation categories, Referer, action URLs, and client location are not
universal return targets. A safe origin is retained before optional-envelope
parsing. Issue #225 adds only `/settings` to the exact HTML-route allowlist. Only server-selected existing
`session-result`, `session-recording`, `match-recording`, and `match-recovery` anchors are appended
separately; client fragments remain rejected.

`language_context.py` retains at most 32 opaque rendered-page bindings, which expire
after 30 minutes, and one pending return overlay. Bindings retain exact source references,
complete immutable content, applicable generations, Review state/step, Match
position movement, selected recovery preview, Report, related transfer target,
and relevant retained feedback. Reopening an identical item and changing away from
and back to a Match position invalidate old bindings. Report/source/prepared-state
changes are also checked. No independent per-tab Product workspace is introduced.

The existing locks protect snapshots; Product locks are never acquired while
holding the app or profile lock. Before a language save and on its return, strict
read-only source-file checks detect external changes without replacing active
state. Applicability is checked again after the separate profile save and before
rendering an overlay. Pre-save conflicts change neither preference nor Product;
post-save conflicts retain the valid saved language and discard inapplicable
presentation values, with distinct localized feedback and applicable navigation.
There is no profile-and-Product transaction, rollback, retry, or automatic repair.

`language_form_preservation.py` derives form identities from the registered action,
stable server-rendered hidden identities, and the exact page manifest. An ordinal
only distinguishes otherwise identical forms within that bound source page.
Restoration rechecks the complete manifest, including the actual selectable
identities. A client cannot restore an unqualified field/ordinal into another
Player, Game, Report, Review step, or form. Transport fields are regenerated from
the validated current state, including the profile generation after saving a
language. Genuine stale Product protection remains in force.

| State | Language-switch behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Accepted Product data, workflow drafts, Results and artifacts | Retained with or without JavaScript; no Product action executes |
| Already submitted safe rejected values and structured issues | Retained with or without JavaScript; issues translated at render time |
| Supported unsent browser controls and disclosure states | Optional JavaScript transfers presentation values in the native language POST |
| Files, passwords, hidden transport, secrets, destructive confirmations | Never copied/restored through the envelope; files require reselection and confirmations must be explicit again |

The enhancement preserves empty values, repeated Cards, selected choices, and
checked/unchecked states, distinguishing omission from explicit clearing. It
preserves open and closed disclosures while forcing validation-required
disclosures open. It sends at most 256 forms and 1,024 disclosure booleans, with
registered per-field length/cardinality/choice limits and a maximum **262,144
UTF-8 bytes** for the envelope. Duplicate JSON keys, malformed structure, foreign
form identities, unsafe choices, and unknown fields are rejected. If browser
capture exceeds its bounds, the script prevents navigation and shows a localized
explanation; it does not truncate or silently drop the draft. The enhancement
honors the actual submitter and never fetches or submits a second request.

Without JavaScript, the server cannot recover unsent values in another browser
form. Such values are not server-held drafts. Neither mode creates persistent
drafts, browser storage, background autosave, or implicitly saved settings.
Every successful change uses full-page PRG with one request-local rendering
locale for header, body, feedback, selector, and HTML `lang`.

Valid #221 source-labelled Results/downloads and #222 previews retain their exact
bytes, selections, and lifetime. Language changes neither execute review nor
prepare, renew, consume, or confirm an Apply selection. Normal edit, reopen,
expiry, and source-change invalidation remain authoritative.

### Focused browser evidence

Issue #228's compact declaration forms reuse this exact-source restoration layer.
Their four checkbox controls preserve unchecked false, while emptied bid/count
remain empty. Private declaration markers, current revisions, selected positions,
correction targets and HMAC bindings are rendered afresh, never copied from the
language envelope. The shared Boolean-select helper and unrelated analysis forms
are unchanged. Current catalogs contain 1,375 matching keys. See
[Compact Game declaration](compact_game_declaration.md) for native and enhanced
de/en error/save/reopen evidence and its installed-Wheel hashes.

Issue #226's compact Card controls use the same exact manifest/checked/repeated
preservation. Native language switching retains server-held rejected selection;
the optional enhancement also carries multiple unsent Cards without a Product
mutation. Card source tokens are regenerated from current state, not copied from
the envelope. An unbound attempted selection stays plain rejected input rather
than the next actor's selected Card. Its separate installed-Wheel JavaScript-on/off
measurements and POST counts are in [Compact Card entry](compact_card_entry.md).

On September 12, synthetic headless Microsoft Edge **152.0.4191.66**, driven with
the standard-library DevTools Protocol harness, exercised Learning English → German
→ English, creation-error switching, and Match recovery. The normal opened
Learning sequence on baseline `80c1d1e` did **not** reproduce the reported inversion;
its original cause remains unestablished. No locale strings were swapped.

Final native-click checks used **1365×900** and **390×844**, JavaScript enabled and
disabled, long synthetic names, actual loaded Capture/Corpus CSS, and keyboard
Enter. Each language activation sent one POST with the named target; URL, HTML
language, pressed state, translated feedback/body, and saved preference agreed.
Enhanced unsent input/disclosure and empty required-field checks passed; oversized
draft capture stayed on the page with no POST. Real Corpus prepared state and
Match bytes/preview identity remained unchanged.

Sanitized evidence is outside the repository at
`<temporary-directory>/opencode/language-223-baseline/` and
`<temporary-directory>/opencode/language-223-final/`. Each has `evidence.json`;
the final directory includes `learning-*`, `learning-error-*`, `creation-error-*`,
`creation-feedback-*`, `recovery-selector-*`, and `recovery-context-*` PNGs for
the viewport/script combinations. The temporary `language_browser.py` and
`language_final_browser.py` harnesses use no added dependency.

The selector and its focus/active states fit both widths. Those #223 inspections
also exposed visual limitations outside that issue: light Learning text on light workflow
panels, and German Match transfer/settings controls extending page width to about
503 pixels at the narrow viewport. The selector and recovery preview remain within
their usable column. This is bounded implementation evidence, **not** a passed
whole-page visual audit or maintainer UAT. Issue #224 subsequently reproduces and
technically remediates these scoped contrast/overflow failures, including expanded
secondary controls; see [Unified workflow visual contract](unified_workflow_visual_contract.md).
The original observations remain history and unresolved UAT findings remain open.

The implementation preserves loopback-only binding, bootstrap token and app
cookie, exact Host and Origin validation, `Referrer-Policy: origin`, CSP,
`no-store`, `nosniff`, frame denial, no CORS, no access log, no external
resource, and value-free authorization failures. Profile and locale values never
change Product semantics or information-use controls.

The reopened Issue #216 follow-up also keeps localized parser-level common
errors safe across CPython 3.13 patch releases. CPython 3.13.15 on Ubuntu left
`BaseHTTPRequestHandler.headers` as a plain empty dictionary for the rejected
two-token HTTP/0.9 request, while the Windows CPython 3.13.7 run exposed a
complete multi-value header object. Browser-language evidence is now accepted
only from the expected complete `email.message.Message` interface. Missing,
`None`, mapping, and partial containers are treated as absent browser evidence,
while saved-profile precedence and deterministic English fallback remain intact.
Malformed GET and POST targets still return hardened HTTP `400`; invalid HTTP
versions and HTTP/0.9 still return hardened HTTP `505`; every path retains all
security headers without access logging or a request-thread traceback.

## Packaging and compatibility

The two locale JSON files are `skatmind.app_web` Package Data. Source, Editable,
Wheel, sdist, clean Wheel, and clean sdist validation checks exact resource
bytes, strict catalog loading, no startup profile write, browser-derived German,
explicit language persistence, saved-language precedence, and restart loading
inside isolated temporary managed roots. Issue #218 adds strict validation-
registry loading and packaged localized-feedback coverage. Issue #219 adds
populated-profile, generated-identifier, bilingual creation, settings, and local
CSS/locale Package-resource coverage. Distribution tests
use no real user profile or browser.

The separate failed `source-resolved` matrix smoke was not caused by locale
handling, Linux, Package Resources, or a CPython patch difference. The outer
validator emitted distinct `compatibility` and canonical `run` Root output
files, but the installed smoke still requested the older unsuffixed filenames.
The smoke now validates both emitted files against the same Public API document.
Matrix child failures retain the installation form, dependency lane, exception
category, sanitized command, and bounded stdout/stderr excerpts with repository
and matrix roots replaced by stable placeholders.

Issue #216 preserves Package `0.17.0`, Python `>=3.13`, `AGPL-3.0-only`, the two
unchanged runtime dependencies, Public API contract `1`, seven Root workflows,
one Console Script, Settlement Matrix version `3` with 61 cases, 71 authoritative
and packaged Schemas, six Session examples, 98 generated outputs, and ten Corpus
downloads.

## Remaining work and UAT

Home grouping and Product terminology are implemented by Issue #217. Validation
and safe submitted-value preservation are implemented by Issue #218 and
documented in
[Frontend validation state and localized feedback](frontend_validation_state_and_localized_feedback.md).
Known Players, profile-driven Player/default behavior, generated IDs, labels,
and simplified bilingual creation forms are implemented by Issue #219 and
documented in [Profile-driven stateful creation](profile_driven_stateful_creation.md).
Task-first active stateful layouts and complete bilingual workflow coverage
are implemented by Issue #220.
