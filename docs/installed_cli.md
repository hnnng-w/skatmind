# Installed CLI

Issue #142 adds installed CLI contract version `1`. The three supported
invocation forms are:

```text
skatmind
python -m skatmind
python main.py
```

`skatmind` and `python -m skatmind` are installed Package interfaces. Repository-
root `python main.py` is the Legacy compatibility interface and remains supported
through at least `v1.0.0`.

Issue #147 adds the same optional `--include-provenance` transport flag to all
three forms. The Package version is `0.17.0`.

Issue #189 adds the same Root Information-set Search modes and validation to all
three forms without adding a Root workflow, command family, or Console Script.
Issue #190 uses the existing `--multi-step` and `--compare-policies` fields for
strict Information-set Search integration and adds no CLI flag.

Issues #150 through #156 establish the Session contracts, replay, export,
Checkpoint, history-edit, persistence, Public API, Provenance, and standalone
Schema foundations. Issue #157 adds Session CLI contract version `1`, stable
public file transport, automatic Checkpoint collection, actual-card observation,
Checkpoint review, explicit Session-triggered Position/Historical execution, and
a phase-aware Assistant. Issue #158 completed Release preparation for the
functional `v0.14.0` milestone, which the maintainer subsequently published
manually at commit `d5589f8`. See
[Public Session API version 1](public_session_api_v1.md)
and [Session CLI and end-to-end capture](session_cli_and_end_to_end_capture.md).

## Product entry and advanced routing

Issue #210 implements bare `skatmind` as the primary local browser application
entry and `skatmind app` as its explicit form, with equal installed, module, and
Legacy routing. Direct `skatmind --input ...`, `session`, `capture`, and `corpus`
remain supported advanced interfaces. The shell options are `--data-root PATH`,
`--port INTEGER`, and `--no-open`.

Issue #213 implements canonical `skatmind run`, concise Product-oriented top-
level help, and complete grouped Root options under `run --help`. Direct Root
options remain Package-1.x compatibility routes. See
[Advanced CLI automation](advanced_cli_automation_interface.md),
[Application shell](unified_local_frontend_application_shell.md), and
[Unified local frontend contract](unified_local_frontend_contract.md).

## Installation

An Editable, Wheel, or sdist installation exposes exactly one Console Script:

```toml
[project.scripts]
skatmind = "skatmind.cli:main"
```

No GUI Script or second command alias is installed. `python -m skatmind` delegates
through `skatmind/__main__.py` to the same Package-owned implementation. The
repository-root `main.py` file is not installed.

Issue #205 is a hard cut: clean installations provide no old import Package,
module form, or Console Script alias. Existing callers must move to the three
forms above. Strict persisted-input compatibility is separate from CLI and import
compatibility; see [SkatMind rename and migration](skatmind_rename_and_migration.md).

## Help and version

Use either installed form from any caller working directory:

```powershell
skatmind --help
python -m skatmind --help
skatmind run --help
python -m skatmind run --help
skatmind --version
python -m skatmind --version
```

The exact installed version output is:

```text
SkatMind 0.17.0
```

The source-only fallback, when distribution metadata is unavailable, is:

```text
SkatMind 0+unknown
```

Help and version exit with Code `0`, write no error output, execute no workflow,
and write no output file. Top-level help and version remain independent of app
server, managed storage, Application handlers, Search, replay, Session, Capture,
Corpus, Schema, and input loading. Installed and module `run` help uses generic
caller paths. Repository examples are not Package Data and are not implied to
exist in an installation. Legacy `run` help may retain repository-focused
`examples/...` commands.

Session help is available with equal installed, module, and Legacy behavior:

```powershell
skatmind session --help
python -m skatmind session --help
python main.py session --help
```

Issue #165 adds the separate local Match Capture family with the same parity:

```powershell
skatmind capture --workspace MATCH.json
python -m skatmind capture --workspace MATCH.json
python main.py capture --workspace MATCH.json
```

Its exact options are required `--workspace PATH`, optional `--port INTEGER`
defaulting to `0`, and `--no-open`. It has no host, remote-bind, force,
authentication-disable, daemon, default-path, or output-file option.

Issue #179 adds the separate private local Learning Corpus family with equal
installed, module, and Legacy behavior:

```powershell
skatmind corpus --corpus CORPUS_ROOT
python -m skatmind corpus --corpus CORPUS_ROOT
python main.py corpus --corpus CORPUS_ROOT
```

Its exact options are required `--corpus PATH`, optional `--port INTEGER` from
`1` through `65535` defaulting to `8766`, and `--no-open`. It has no host,
remote-bind, Workspace, force, generate, daemon, default-root, or output option.

## Options and execution

All three forms share canonical parsers and the same option names, aliases,
destinations, actions, defaults, choices, repeatability, and semantic validation.
Issue #142 added `--version`; Issue #147 added Root `--include-provenance`;
Issue #157 delegates a leading `session` token to the separate Session parser.
Issue #165 adds `capture`; Issue #179 adds `corpus`; Issue #210 routes empty argv
and leading `app` to the unified shell. Issue #213 adds leading `run`, then
retains `session`, `capture`, and `corpus`; top-level help/version are lightweight,
option-like first tokens retain Root compatibility, and other non-option tokens
are unknown commands. Full option lists are available through `app --help`,
`run --help`, `session --help`, `capture --help`, and `corpus --help`.

The Information-set Search Root additions are:

```text
--historical-information-set-search-review
--information-set-search-evaluation
```

Both require explicit `--search-seed` and reuse
`--search-budget-profile`. Historical Review also reuses `--samples` and
`--seed`; its default profile is `historical_review_v1`. It conflicts with
`--historical-search-review` and `--historical-replay-coaching` rather than
combining with either. Dataset evaluation is mutually exclusive with
`--evaluate-bounded-search` and the other Training Dataset operations. It
defaults to canonical validation/test order and profile `evaluation_v1`;
repeatable `--search-evaluation-partition` and positive
`--search-evaluation-max-decisions` retain their existing meanings.

Issue #194 adds Root `--historical-tactical-motif-review`. It accepts only
Historical Game input, requires no Search settings, and may accompany either
Replay Coaching family. Installed, module, and Legacy Root invocation produce
the same strict JSON and aggregate-only human-readable presentation. `--quiet`
continues to suppress successful presentation without changing file output.

Flat Position input selects
`recommendation_method: "information_set_search"` and supplies all nine strict
`information_set_search_settings` fields in JSON. There are no separate flat
CLI budget overrides. Existing `auto` remains PIMC first with its existing
Immediate fallback and never silently selects Information-set Search.

The same JSON method and settings now work with existing Multi-Step options:

```powershell
skatmind run --input position.json --multi-step 1
skatmind run --input position.json --multi-step 1 --compare-policies
```

The existing card-policy matching rule applies. Every local decision performs
fresh strict Search from public state and stops without fallback when no
recommendation exists. Policy Comparison appends `information_set_search`
exactly once and last to the default four policies. Existing `--comparison-only`,
`--quiet`, `--include-provenance`, and human-readable fields are unchanged; no
`information_set_auto` method or Issue-#190 option exists.

The CLI preserves this transport sequence:

1. Parse arguments.
2. Load the Root input.
3. Detect the Root workflow.
4. Validate CLI-only options.
5. Load optional external Opponent Statistics.
6. Construct internal Application options.
7. Execute the Application directly.
8. Optionally attach bounded public-safe field provenance.
9. Write requested Root output.
10. Write a requested auxiliary Opponent Statistics export.
11. Print human-readable output unless `--quiet` is supplied.
12. Print file confirmations unless `--quiet` is supplied.

The CLI does not execute `skatmind.api.v1` as an intermediate layer. It uses the
same internal Application orchestration as the Public Python API while retaining
CLI-specific file transport, validation, and presentation.

Session transport is the bounded exception: Session operations use the stable
Public Session and Public Session File APIs, while explicit `analyze`, `review`,
and `finalize` export Requests and invoke the same existing Application once.
This does not add an Engine workflow.

Capture transport is private and internal. It strictly resumes or creates one
explicit Match Workspace, binds only to `127.0.0.1`, and delegates one browser
operation at a time to existing Match Capture services followed by optimistic
atomic Save. Ordinary capture operations do not execute analysis. Issue #168's
separate explicit analysis actions invoke the existing Position or Historical
Application once; materialization executes no workflow.

Corpus transport is private and internal. It strictly resumes one explicit
non-empty Corpus or presents caller-ID initialization for an absent/empty root,
then composes existing Corpus import/selection and Dataset-v2 builders through
explicit browser actions. Strategy Teacher Report sources and prepared derived
artifacts are process-local. It executes no analysis and adds no Root workflow,
Public API, Schema, or derived persistence. See
[Learning Corpus browser workflows](learning_corpus_browser_workflows.md).

## Input and output

Use caller-owned paths with either installed form:

```powershell
skatmind run --input position.json
python -m skatmind run --input historical-game.json --output result.json --quiet
skatmind run --input position.json --include-provenance --output result.json
```

Without `--quiet`, successful workflows preserve the existing human-readable
headings, labels, ordering, and privacy boundaries. By default, `--output` writes
the unchanged Root JSON document. `--quiet` suppresses successful human-readable
output and file confirmations but does not suppress errors.

`--include-provenance` adds Root `field_provenance` for every Root workflow.
Without `--quiet`, the CLI prints only a concise aggregate section with version,
status, Result attachment, covered/total leaves, whether private dependencies
were redacted, and artifact attachment count. It does not print ledger entries,
field paths, references, cards, or Player IDs. With `--quiet`, the section is
suppressed while the JSON sidecar is still written.

Historical Opponent Statistics aggregation may write its separate reusable
artifact with `--export-opponent-statistics`. The auxiliary JSON remains outside
the primary Root output and uses the existing `opponent_statistics_input` shape.
When provenance is requested, the Root sidecar maps that actual artifact to
`training_dataset/opponent_statistics_input` with scope `artifact_document`; the
separate export document itself remains unchanged and has no nested sidecar.

## Session command family

The canonical Session subcommands are, in order:

```text
new
show
apply
undo
correct
checkpoint
export-position
export-historical
analyze
review
finalize
assistant
```

`new` creates an explicit caller-selected private file from strict JSON; `show`
strictly loads it; `apply`, `undo`, and `correct` save only applicable State
changes; and `checkpoint` collects or reuses one exact Position-ready frozen
Request. `export-position` and `export-historical` construct existing Requests
without execution. `analyze`, `review`, and `finalize` explicitly execute the
existing Position or Historical Application once when their export is available.
`assistant` provides deterministic phase-aware prompts and saves each accepted
State change.

Applicable commands use required `--session PATH`, optional or required
`--output PATH`, `--quiet`, and `--include-provenance`. Position-related commands
use `--samples`, `--seed`, `--opponent-strategy`, `--recommendation-method`, and
`--search-budget-profile`. `finalize` uses the existing Historical Snapshot,
Immediate Review, Search Review, Replay Coaching, Search seed/profile, and
Immediate sample/seed options. `assistant` accepts only explicit `--session`.

Mutations use strict load-operate-compare-and-swap-save with the loaded content
fingerprint. There is no default path, directory creation, force overwrite,
backup, merge, retry, or hidden reload. Automatic Checkpoint collection captures
Position-ready source decisions before accepted local Plays and Position-ready
resulting States, deduplicates exact equal Checkpoints, and never starts analysis
on its own.

See [Session CLI and end-to-end capture](session_cli_and_end_to_end_capture.md)
for exact per-subcommand options, JSON output shapes, privacy, persistence, and
Assistant behavior.

## Errors and Exit Codes

The stable process Exit Codes are:

```text
0 = success
1 = expected execution or resource failure
2 = CLI usage failure
```

Semantic CLI errors use `SkatMindCliUsageError`, the `CLI error:` prefix, and Code
`2`. Standard `argparse` syntax and unknown-option errors also use Code `2`.
Expected `ValueError` and `OSError` failures use the `Error:` prefix and Code
`1`. Unexpected exception classes are not broadly caught.

Valid incomplete or unavailable Domain states remain successful, including
Search `partial`, `timeout`, or `unavailable`, Dataset Preparation `unavailable`,
list `lot_required`, Coaching `not_assessable`, rejected or revision-conflict
Session Commands, unavailable Session exports, unchanged Undo, partial
Correction, pending observations, and diverged Checkpoints. Session Save
conflicts, invalid persistence files, and filesystem failures use Code `1`.
Capture parser misuse uses Code `2`; invalid existing Workspace, missing parent,
bind, or filesystem failures use Code `1`; a normal `Ctrl+C` shutdown uses Code
`0`. Browser validation uses HTTP `400`, security rejection `403`, unknown route
`404`, unsupported method `405`, revision or persistence conflict `409`, request
limit `413`, and generic internal failure `500`.

Corpus parser misuse uses Code `2`; invalid root/Store, missing parent, bind, or
filesystem failures use Code `1`; normal `Ctrl+C` uses Code `0`. Corpus browser
validation uses HTTP `400`, security rejection `403`, unavailable download `404`,
unsupported method `405`, revision/persistence/source-change conflict `409`,
request limit `413`, and generic internal failure `500`.

## Compatibility

The canonical implementation is under `skatmind.cli`. Root `main.py` is a thin
compatibility facade that preserves its existing importable wrappers, validators,
formatters, Exit Code constants, `CliUsageError` alias, callable signatures, and
established monkeypatch seams. A patched Root seam affects Legacy execution but
does not require the installed Package CLI to import Root `main.py`.

Canonical Root JSON automation uses explicit input:

```powershell
skatmind run --input REQUEST.json
python -m skatmind run --input REQUEST.json
python main.py run --input REQUEST.json
```

Direct `skatmind --input ...`, module, and Legacy equivalents remain accepted
Package-1.x compatibility routes without warnings. Their input default, stdout,
stderr, JSON, bytes, quiet behavior, errors, Exit Codes, Provenance, Artifacts,
and supplied-option tracking remain unchanged.

Issue #162 keeps `skatmind.cli.execution` and `skatmind.cli.session` as explicit
compatibility facades while focused internal modules own parsing, validation,
Application adaptation, dispatch, transport, persistence/Checkpoint
orchestration, and presentation. The Session Assistant imports those focused
services rather than facade-private helpers. This changes no command, option,
output, Exit Code, Console Script, or compatibility version. See
[CLI internal architecture](cli_internal_architecture.md).

CLI functions and installed-CLI constants remain internal and are not stable
Public Python API exports. Issue #147 additively extends `skatmind.api.v1`, Root
JSON Schema, and generated scenarios while preserving default Root JSON and the
flattened Public API envelope.

## Distribution validation

The existing single distribution validator builds one Wheel and one sdist. Its
clean environments verify exact Console Script metadata, module entry-point
inclusion, Root-main exclusion, help, version, Root JSON parity, normal failure
boundaries, provenance/quiet behavior, all 71 Schema Resources, and `py.typed`.
Issue #157 also verifies the public Session file namespace and Save/Load,
installed/module Session help, `new`/`apply`/`show`, Position analysis,
observation/review, Retrospective finalization, and an injected-I/O Assistant
smoke flow. Legacy Session parity is checked from the repository checkout. No
second Console Script is installed. Issue #165 additionally verifies Capture
resources, installed/module Capture help, loopback token bootstrap, browser
creation, Game start, Declaration, Card append, strict persistence Resume, and
clean shutdown. Legacy Capture parity remains a repository-checkout gate. The
local Full invokes that validator; CI reuses its strict helpers in [six cells](faster_validation.md).
Issue #179 additionally verifies Corpus Web resource bytes, installed/module and
Legacy Corpus help, one-root initialization, strict Workspace import, explicit
Current selection, exact Match Report-source transfer, explicit Dataset-v2
preparation, all seven canonical downloads, invalidation, and shutdown. It adds
no second Console Script or 64th Schema.
Issue #189 additionally verifies installed/module/Legacy Information-set Search
help and execution parity, packaged four-Schema loading, strict Live execution,
Historical Review, and Training Dataset evaluation. It adds no eighth Root
workflow, second Console Script, or Public API contract version.
Issue #190 preserves those interfaces while adding Multi-Step and Policy
Comparison execution through existing options. Its point-in-time Schema count
remains 69; Issues #192 and #194 subsequently bring the current total to 71.
Issue #191 adds no installed CLI flag or command. The existing private `capture`
and `corpus` browser transports carry strict one-Decision Match Information-set
Reports and focused Teacher/Dataset artifacts through their existing operations.
Issues #195 and #196 extend current Corpus validation to the two Tactical
downloads and one Coaching download for ten total without adding a Console
Script.
Issue #213 additionally verifies concise Product help, grouped advanced help,
canonical/direct Root parity, explicit input, invocation identity, and unchanged
Session/Capture/Corpus help across Source, Editable, Wheel, sdist, and clean
installations.

## Boundaries

Functional Issues #165 and #179 themselves changed no Package version, Root
workflow, Root parser meaning, second Console Script, publication state, default
Session path, Public API, Schema, example, or generated scenario. Issue #180
changes only Package version and matching release expectations to `0.16.0`.
Session persistence
files and explicit JSON outputs remain private caller-controlled data; concise
human output does not print complete private hands, full Skat, frozen Requests,
fingerprints, provenance entries, or file contents by default. The Match and
Learning Corpus browsers are private loopback-only local transports. The current
Package includes the unified local application shell, process-local guided
Analyze/Review workflows, and Issue #212 managed Session, Match, and Learning
lifecycles over the existing authoritative persistence and operations. Bare and
explicit `app` launch also expose the Issue-#219 private profile-driven creation,
known-Player/default settings, generated frontend identities, friendly labels,
and secondary imports documented in [Profile-driven stateful
creation](profile_driven_stateful_creation.md). The
standalone `session`, `capture`, and `corpus` commands remain supported advanced
interfaces. Hosted or remote browser deployment, online-platform integration,
cloud synchronization, distributed locking, encryption/key management, and
automatic backups remain open.
Information-set Search remains bounded to its documented flat, Multi-Step, Policy
Comparison, Historical Review, Training Dataset evaluation, private one-Decision
Match/Teacher, Match Historical, and Replay Coaching routes. Issue #193 supplies
the bounded repository-local performance evidence. Production acceptance
criteria and cross-machine latency guarantees remain later v1 decisions rather
than v0.17.0 Release blockers.
